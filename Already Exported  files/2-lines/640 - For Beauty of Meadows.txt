640 - For Beauty of Meadows

Verse 1
For beauty of meadows, for grandeur of trees,
For flowers of woodlands, for creatures of seas,

Verse 1
For all You created and gave us to share,
We praise You, Creator, extolling your care.

Verse 2
As stewards of beauty received at Your hand,
As creatures who hear Your most urgent command,

Verse 2
We turn from our wasteful destruction of life,
Confessing our failures, confessing our strife.

Verse 3
Teach us once again to be gardeners in peace;
All nature around us is ours but on lease;

Verse 3
Your name we would hallow in all that we do,
Fulfilling our calling, creating with You.
