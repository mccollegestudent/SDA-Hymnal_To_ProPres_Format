225 - God Is Working His Purpose Out

Verse 1
God is working His purpose out
As year suceeds to year;

Verse 1
God is working His purpose out,
And the time is drawing near;

Verse 1
Nearer and nearer draws the time,
The time that shall surely be

Verse 1
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

Verse 2
From utmost east to utmost west,
Where'er man's foot hath trod,

Verse 2
By the mouth of many messengers
Goes forth the voice of God;

Verse 2
Give ear to me, ye confinents,
Ye isles, give ear to me,

Verse 2
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

Verse 3
March we forth in the strength of God
With the banner of Christ unfurled,

Verse 3
That the light of the glorious gospel of truth
May shine throughout the world:

Verse 3
Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin
To set their captives free,

Verse 3
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.

Verse 4
All we can do is nothing worth
Unless God blesses the deed;

Verse 4
Vainly we hope for the harvest tide
Till God gives life to teh seed;

Verse 4
Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,
The time that shall surely be,

Verse 4
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God
As the waters cover the sea.
