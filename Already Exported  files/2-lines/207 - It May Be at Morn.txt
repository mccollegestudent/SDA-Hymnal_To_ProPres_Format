When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking,

Ere we shout the glad song?

When Jesus receives His own.

Ere we shout the glad song?

No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying,

Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,
When Jesus receives His own.

Ere we shout the glad song?
