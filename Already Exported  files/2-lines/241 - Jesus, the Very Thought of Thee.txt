241 - Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee

Verse 1
Jesus, the very thought of thee 
with sweetness fills the breast; 

Verse 1
but sweeter far thy face to see, 
and in thy presence rest.

Verse 2
No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find

Verse 2
A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,
The Savior of mankind.

Verse 3
O hope of every contrite heart!
O joy of all the meek, 

Verse 3
to those who fall, how kind thou art! 
How good to those who seek!

Verse 4
But what to those who find? Ah, this 
nor tongue nor pen can show; 

Verse 4
the love of Jesus, what it is, 
none but his loved ones know.

Verse 5
Jesus, our only joy be thou, 
as thou our prize wilt be; 

Verse 5
Jesus, be thou our glory now, 
and through eternity.
