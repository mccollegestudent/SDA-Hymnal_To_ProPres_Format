O let me from this day

be wholly Thine.

May thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart,

As thou hast died for me,

While life's dark maze I tread,
and griefs around me spread,

be thou my guide;
bid darkness turn to day,

wipe sorrow's tears away,
nor let me ever stray

from Thee aside.
