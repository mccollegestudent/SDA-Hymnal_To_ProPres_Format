Fearlessly speaking the word of the Lord,

Blessing for cursing, and peace for the sword.

Guiding and guarding the souls in their care,

Helping the needy their burdens to bear.

Guiding to wisdom the young and the old,

Training for worship and witness and service,
Foes to all falsehood, in truthfulness bold.

Each needing other, and all having worth;

So to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit,
Glory be shown by the church here on earth.
