291 - We Have Not Known Thee 

Verse 1
We have not known Thee as we ought,
Nor learned Thy wisdom, grace, and power;

Verse 1
The things of earth have filed our thoughts,
And trifles of the passing hour.

Verse 1
Lord, give us light Thy truth to see,
And make us wise in knowing Thee.

Verse 2
We have not feared Thee as we ought,
Nor bowed beneath Thine awful eye,

Verse 2
Nor guarded deed, and word, and thought,
Remembering that God was nigh.

Verse 2
Lord, give us faith to know Thee near,
And grant the grace of holy fear.

Verse 3
We have not loved Thee as we ought,
Nor cared that we are loved by Thee;

Verse 3
Thy presence we have coldly sought,
And feebly longed Thy face to see.

Verse 3
Lord, give a pure and loving heart
To feel and own the love Thou art.

Verse 4
We have not served Thee as we ought;
Alas! the duties left undone,

Verse 4
The work with little fervor wrought,
The battles lost, or scarcely won!

Verse 4
Lord, give the zeal, and give the might,
For Thee to toil, for Thee to fight.

Verse 5
When shall we know Thee as we ought,
And fear, and love, and serve aright!

Verse 5
When shall we, out of trial brought,
Be perfect in the land of light!

Verse 5
Lord, may we day by day prepare
To see Thy face, and serve Thee there.
