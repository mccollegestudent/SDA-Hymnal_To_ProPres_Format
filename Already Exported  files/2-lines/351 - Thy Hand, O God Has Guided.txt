Verse 1
Thy hand, O God, has guided
Thy flock from age to age;

Verse 1
The wondrous tale is written
Full clear on every page;

Verse 1
Our fathers owned Thy goodness,
And we their deeds record;

Verse 1
And both of this bear witness,
One church, one faith, one Lord.

Verse 2
Thy heralds brought glad tidings
To greatest as to least;

Verse 2
They bade men rise and hasten
To share the great King's feast:

Verse 2
And this was all their teaching,
In every deed and word,

Verse 2
To all alike proclaiming
One church, one faith, one Lord.

Verse 3
When shadows thick were falling,
And all seemed sunk in night,

Verse 3
Thou, Lord, did send Thy servants,
Thy chosen sons of light.

Verse 3
On them and on Thy people
Thy plenteous grace was poured,

Verse 3
And this was still their message:
One church, one faith, one Lord.

Verse 4
Thy mercy will not fail us,
Nor leave Thy work undone;

Verse 4
With Thy right hand to help us,
The vict'ry shall be won;

Verse 4
And then by men and angels
Thy name shall be adored,

Verse 4
And this shall be their anthem:
One church, one faith, one Lord.
