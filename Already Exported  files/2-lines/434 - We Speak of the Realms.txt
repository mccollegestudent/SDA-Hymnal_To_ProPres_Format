434 - We Speak of the Realms

Verse 1
We speak of the realms of the blest,
That country so bright and so fair,

Verse 1
And oft are its glories confessed-
But what must it be to be there!

Verse 1
We speak of its pathway of gold-
Its walls decked with jewels so rare,

Verse 1
Its wonders and pleasures untold-
But what must it be to be there!

Verse 2
We speak of its freedom of sin,
From sorrow, temptation and care,

Verse 2
From trials without and within---
But what must it be to be there!

Verse 2
We  speak of its service of love,
Of the robes which glorified wear,

Verse 2
Of the church of the First Born above-
But what must it  be to be there!

Verse 3
Our mourning is all at an end,
When, raised by the life-giving word,

Verse 3
We see the new city descend,
Adorned as a bride for her Lord;

Verse 3
The city so holy and clean,
No sorrow can breathe in the air;

Verse 3
No gloom of affliction or sin,
No shadow of evil, is there.

Verse 4
Do Thou, midst temptation and woe,
For heaven my spirit prepare;

Verse 4
And shortly I also so shall know
And feel what it is to be there.

Verse 4
Then o'er the bright fields we shall roam,
In glory celestial and fair,

Verse 4
With saints and with angels at home,
And Jesus Himself will be there.
