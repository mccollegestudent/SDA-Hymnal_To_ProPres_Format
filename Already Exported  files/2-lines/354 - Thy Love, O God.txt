Verse 1
Thy love, O God, has all mankind created,
And led Thy people to this present hour;

Verse 1
In Christ we see life's glory consummated;
Thy Spirit manifests His living power.

Verse 2
From out the darkness of our hope's frustration,
From all the broken idols of our pride,

Verse 2
We turn to seek Thy truth's illumination,
And find Thy mercy waiting at our side.

Verse 3
In pity look upon Thy children's striving
For life and freedom, peace and brotherhood,

Verse 3
Till at the fullness of Thy truth arriving,
We find in Christ the crown of every good.

Verse 4
Inspire Thy church, mid earth's discordant voices,
To preach the gospel of her Lord above,

Verse 4
Until the day this warring world rejoices
To hear the mighty harmonies of love.
