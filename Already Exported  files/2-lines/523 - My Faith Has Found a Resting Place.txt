Not in a manmade creed;

That He for me shall plead.

I need no other plea;

And rose again for me.

This ends my fear and doubt;

A sinful soul, I come to Him,
He will not cast me out.

I need no other plea;

And rose again for me.

The living Word of God,

Salvation in my Savior's name,
Salvation through His blood.

I need no other plea;

And rose again for me.

My great Physician heals the sick,
The lost He came to save;

For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave.

I need no other plea;

It is enough that Jesus died,
And rose again for me.
