like the wideness of the sea;

There is mercy, with the Savior,
Which is more than liberty.

Verse 2
There is welcome, for the sinner,
and more graces for the good;

Verse 2
There is mercy, with the Savior,
There is healing in His blood.

Verse 3
For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of man's mind.

Verse 3
And the heart of the Eternal,
is most wonderfully kind.

Verse 4
If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His word;

And our lives would be all sunshine,
In the sweetness of our Lord.
