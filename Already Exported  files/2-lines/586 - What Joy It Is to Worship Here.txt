586 - What Joy It Is to Worship Here

Verse 1
What joy it is to worship here,
And find ourselves at home,

Verse 1
Where God, who uses every gift,
Has room for all who come!

Verse 2
Yet are no two of us alike
Of all the human race,

Verse 2
And we must seek a common ground
If we would share His grace.
