628 - As Jacob With Travel Was Weary

Verse 1
As Jacob with travel was weary one day,
At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;

Verse 1
He saw in a vision a ladder so high
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.

Chorus
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,

Chorus
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.

Verse 2
Come let us ascend! All may climb it who will;
For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:

Verse 2
And remember each step that by faith we passo'er,
Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.

Chorus
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,

Chorus
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.

Verse 3
And when we arrive at the haven of rest
We shall hear the glad words, "Come up hither, ye blest,

Verse 3
Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss."
O who would not climb such a ladder as this?

Chorus
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,

Chorus
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.
