Life is great! So sing about it,
As we can and as we should-

Shop and buses, towns and people,
Village, farmland, field and wood,

Life is great and life is given;
Life is lovely, free and good.

Life is great!- what ever happens,
Snow or sunshine, joy or pain,

Hardship, grief or disillusion,
Suffering that I can't explain-

Life is great if someone loves me,
Holds my hand and calls my name.

Verse 3
Love is great!- the love of lovers,
Whispered words and longing eyes;

Love that gazes at the cradle
Where a child of loving lies;

Love that lasts when youth has faded,
Bends with age, but never dies.

Love is giving and receiving-
Boy and girl, or friend with friend;

All the hurts that hate can send;

Hoping, trusting to the end.

God is great! in  Christ He loved us,
As we should, but never can-

When disciples turned and ran,

Praise that loving, living Man!
