Verse 1
Alleluia! sing to Jesus! His the scepter, His the throne.
Alleluia! His the triumph, His the victory alone.

Verse 1
Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood.
Jesus out of every nation has redeemed us by His blood.

Verse 2
Alleluia! not as orphans are we left in sorrow now;
Alleluia! He is near us, faith believes, nor questions how;

Verse 2
Though the cloud from sight received Him when the forty days were o'er
Shall our hearts forget His promise, "I am with you evermore"?

Verse 3
Alleluia! bread of angels, Thou on earth our food, our stay;
Alleluia! here the sinful flee to Thee from day to day:

Verse 3
Intercessor, Friend of sinners, Earth's Redeemer, plead for me,
Where the songs of all the sinless sweep across the crystal sea.
