478 - Sweet Hour of Prayer

Verse 1
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer! 
that calls me from a world of care, 

Verse 1
and bids me at my Father's throne 
make all my wants and wishes known. 

Verse 1
In seasons of distress and grief, 
my soul has often found relief, 

Verse 1
and oft escaped the tempter's snare 
by thy return, sweet hour of prayer! 

Verse 2
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer! 
thy wings shall my petition bear 

Verse 2
to him whose truth and faithfulness 
engage the waiting soul to bless. 

Verse 2
And since he bids me seek his face, 
believe his word, and trust his grace, 

Verse 2
I'll cast on him my every care, 
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer! 

Verse 3
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer! 
May I thy consolation share

Verse 3
Till from Mount Pisgah's lofty height
I view my home and take my flight.

Verse 3
In my immortal flesh I'll rise
To size the everlasting prize.

Verse 3
And shout while passing through the air,
"Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"
