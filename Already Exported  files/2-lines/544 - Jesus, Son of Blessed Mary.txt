Verse 1
Jesus, Son of blessed Mary,
Once on earth a little child,

Verse 1
Pattern fair of holy living,
Gracious, loving, undefiled;

Verse 2
Though Thy eager heart was yearning 
Heavy laden souls to free,

Verse 2
Yet Thou calledst little children
In their happiness to Thee.

Grant that we, like little children,
Free from pride and guile my be;

Cheerful, trusting, safe, protected
By the blessed Trinity.
