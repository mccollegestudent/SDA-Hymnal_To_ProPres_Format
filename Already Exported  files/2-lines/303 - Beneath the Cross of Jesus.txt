303 - Beneath the Cross of Jesus

Verse 1
Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,

Verse 1
the shadow of a mighty rock
within a weary land;

Verse 1
a home within the wilderness,
a rest upon the way,

Verse 1
from the burning of the noontide heat,
and the burden of the day.

Verse 2
Upon that cross of Jesus
mine eye at times can see

Verse 2
the very dying form of One
who suffered there for me;

Verse 2
and from my stricken heart with tears
two wonders I confess:

Verse 2
the wonders of redeeming love
and my unworthiness.

Verse 3
I take, O cross, thy shadow
for my abiding place;

Verse 3
I ask no other sunshine than
the sunshine of his face;

Verse 3
content to let the world go by,
to know no gain nor loss,

Verse 3
my sinful self my only shame,
my glory all the cross.
