149 - Once in Royal David's City

Verse 1
Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,

Verse 1
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed;

Verse 1
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little Child.

Verse 2
He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,

Verse 2
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall;

Verse 2
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
Lived on earth our Savior holy.

Verse 3
And through all His wondrous childhood
He would honor and obey,

Verse 3
Love and watch the lowly mother
In whose gentle arms He lay.

Verse 3
Christian children all must be
Mild, obedient, good as He.

Verse 4
And our eyes at last shall see Him,
Through His own redeeming love;

Verse 4
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above;

Verse 4
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone.
