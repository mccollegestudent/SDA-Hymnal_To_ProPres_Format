The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide!

When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away;

Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?

Verse 3
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.

Verse 4
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!
