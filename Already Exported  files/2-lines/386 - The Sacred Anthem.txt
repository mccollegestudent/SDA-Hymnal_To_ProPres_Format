Intro
386 - The Sacred Anthem

Verse 1
The sacred anthem slowly rang
Across the fields of praise,

Verse 1
When earth's first Sabbath made complete
All creatures and all days.

Verse 1
Walking with God, there,
Woman and man together share

Verse 1
The blessed Sabbath mood;
And in that green and golden world

Verse 1
Know all God's works are good.

Verse 2
But now in our diminished lives
We sing a blemished song;

Verse 2
The earth is worn and disarrayed
And all our work goes wrong.

Verse 2
Still in our worship,
Joining in praise and fellowship,

Verse 2
By Sabbath radiance blessed,
We put our doubt and fear away

Verse 2
And rest within God's rest.

Verse 3
And arching over time and space
The Lord of Sabbaths wills

Verse 3
Renewal for the weary earth
And healing for our ills.

Verse 3
Hearts will rejoice then;
There will be no more weeping, when

Verse 3
We know and shall be known.
With hosts of the redeemed we'll sing

Verse 3
Around God's shining throne.
