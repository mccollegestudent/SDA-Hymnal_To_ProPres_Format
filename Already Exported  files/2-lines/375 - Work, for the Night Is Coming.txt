Work through the morning hours;

Work 'mid springing flow'rs.

Work in the glowing sun;

When man's work is done.

Work thro' the sunny noon;

Fill brightest hours with labor,
Rest comes sure and soon.

Something to keep in store;

When man works no more.

Work for the night is coming,
Under the sunset skies;

While their bright tints are glowing,
Work for daylight flies.

Work till the last beam fadeth,
Fadeth to shine no more;

Work while the night is dark'ning,
When man's work is o'er.
