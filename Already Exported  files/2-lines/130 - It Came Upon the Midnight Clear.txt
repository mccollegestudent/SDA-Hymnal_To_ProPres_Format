130 - It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

Verse 1
It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,

Verse 1
From angels bending near the earth,
To touch their harps of gold:

Verse 1
"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King!"

Verse 1
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Verse 2
Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;

Verse 2
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:

Verse 2
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,

Verse 2
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

Verse 3
O ye beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,

Verse 3
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;

Verse 3
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;

Verse 3
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.
