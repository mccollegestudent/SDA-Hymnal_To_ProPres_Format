He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!

A child of the King:

Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;

That we may be His when He comes by and by.

A child of the King:

A sinner by choice, an alien by birth,

An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.

A child of the King:

A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
They're building a palace for me over there;

All glory to God, I'm a child of the King.

A child of the King:
