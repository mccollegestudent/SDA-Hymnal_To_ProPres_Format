Intro
302 - Deeper Yet

Verse 1
In the blood from the cross,
I have been washed from sin;

Verse 1
But to be free from dross,
Still I would enter in.

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.

Verse 2
Day by day, hour by hour,
Blessings are sent to me;

Verse 2
But for more of His power,
Ever my prayer shall be.

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.

Verse 3
Near to Christ I would live,
Following Him each day;

Verse 3
What I ask He will give;
So then with faith I pray.

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.

Verse 4
Now I have peace, sweet peace,
While in this world of sin;

Verse 4
But to pray I'll not cease
Till I am pure within.

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Under the precious blood.
