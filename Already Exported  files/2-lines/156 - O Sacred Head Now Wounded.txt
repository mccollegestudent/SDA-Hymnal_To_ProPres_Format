156 - O Sacred Head Now Wounded

Verse 1
O sacred Head, now wounded, 
with grief and shame weighed down, 

Verse 1
now scornfully surounded 
with thorns, thine only crown: 

Verse 1
how pale thou art with anguish, 
with sore abuse and scorn! 

Verse 1
How does that visage languish 
which once was bright as morn! 

Verse 2
What thou, my Lord, has suffered 
was all for sinners' gain; 

Verse 2
mine, mine was the transgression, 
but thine the deadly pain. 

Verse 2
Lo, here I fall, my Savior! 
'Tis I deserve thy place; 

Verse 2
look on me with thy favor, 
vouchsafe to me thy grace. 

Verse 3
What language shall I borrow 
to thank thee, dearest friend, 

Verse 3
for this thy dying sorrow, 
thy pity without end? 

Verse 3
O make me thine forever; 
and should I fainting be, 

Verse 3
Lord, let me never, never 
outlive my love for thee.
