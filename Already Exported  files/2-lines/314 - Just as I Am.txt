314 - Just as I Am

Verse 1
Just as I am, without one plea, 
but that thy blood was shed for me, 

Verse 1
and that thou bidst me come to thee, 
O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 

Verse 2
Just as I am, and waiting not 
to rid my soul of one dark blot, 

Verse 2
to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, 
O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 

Verse 3
Just as I am, though tossed about 
with many a conflict, many a doubt, 

Verse 3
fightings and fears within, without, 
O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 

Verse 4
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind; 
sight, riches, healing of the mind, 

Verse 4
yea, all I need in thee to find, 
O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 

Verse 5
Just as I am, thou wilt receive, 
wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; 

Verse 5
because thy promise I believe, 
O Lamb of God, I come, I come. 

Verse 6
Just as I am, thy love I own 
hath broken every barrier down; 

Verse 6
now, to be thine, and thine alone, 
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
