Intro
581 - When the Church of Jesus

Verse 1
When the church of Jesus shuts its outer door,
Lest the roar of traffic drown the voice of prayer:

Verse 1
May our prayers, Lord make up ten times more aware
That the world we banish is our Christian care.

Verse 2
If our hearts are lifted where devotion soars
High above this hungry suffering world of ours:

Verse 2
Lest our hymns should drug us to forget its needs,
Forge our Christian worship into Christian deeds.

Verse 3
Lest the gifts we offer, money, talents, time,
Serve to salve our conscience to our secret shame:

Verse 3
Lord, reprove, inspire us by the way you give;
Teach us, dying Savior, how true Christians live.
