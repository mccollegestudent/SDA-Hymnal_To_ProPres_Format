398 - Bread of the World

Verse 1
Bread of the world in mercy broken,
Wine of the soul in mercy shed,

Verse 1
By whom the words of life are spoken,
And in whose death our sins are dead;

Verse 2
Look on the heart by sorrow broken,
Look on the tears by sinners shed;

Verse 2
And be Thy feast to us the token
That by Thy grace our souls are fed. Amen.
