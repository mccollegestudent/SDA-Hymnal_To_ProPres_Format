Lord of the boundless curves of space
And time's deep mystery,

All nature's energy.

Your mind conceived the galaxy,
Each atom's secret planned,

Verse 2
And every age of history
Your purpose, Lord, has spanned.

Yours is the image stamped on man,
Though marred by man's own sin;

And Yours the liberating plan
Again his soul to win.

Give us to know Your truth; but more,
The strength to do Your will;

Verse 4
Until the love our souls adore
Shall all our being fill.
