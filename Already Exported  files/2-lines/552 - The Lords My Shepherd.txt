552 - The Lord's My Shepherd

Verse 1
The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want.
He makes me down to lie

Verse 1
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

Verse 2
My soul He doth restore again.
And me to walk doth make

Verse 2
Within the paths of righteousness,
E'en for His own name's sake.

Verse 3
Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill,

Verse 3
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

Verse 4
My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;

Verse 4
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

Verse 5
Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me;

Verse 5
And in God's house forevermore
My dwelling place shall be.
