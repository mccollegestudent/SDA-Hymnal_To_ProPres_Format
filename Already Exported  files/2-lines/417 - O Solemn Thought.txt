O solemn thought and can it be
The hour o judgment now is come

Which soon must fix our destiny,
And seal the sinner's fearful down?

Descend in vengeance on His foes.

He who came down to earth to die
An offering for the sins of men,

And then ascended upon on high,
And will e'er long return again,

And mercy seat and cherubim,

Verse 2
To plead His blood for saints, and make
The last remembrance of their sin.

When we who have His name confessed,

And pass the final, searching test.

Confess our names before the throne,
And blot our sins fromout Thy book.

O blessed Savior! may we feel
The full importance of this hour.

And aid us by Thy Spirit's power,

And brave the conflict valiantly;

Then, on Mount Zion, join the song,
And swell the notes of victory.
