219 - When Jesus Comes in Glory

Verse 1
When Jesus comes in glory,
As Lord and King of kings,

Verse 1
O what a wondrous story
The blessed Bible brings:

Verse 1
His face will shine like sunlight,
His head be white as snow,

Verse 1
His eyes like flaming firelight,
His feet like brass aglow.

Verse 2
His voice like rushing waters
Will reach with mighty sound

Verse 2
Into the deepest quarters
Of all creation round;

Verse 2
And at this wondrous greeting
The dead in Christ shall rise,

Verse 2
Their Lord and Savior meeting
In glory in the skies.

Verse 3
And we who are believing
And His appearing love,

Verse 3
Shall know we are receiving
His glory from above;

Verse 3
His resurrection power
Will raise us to the place

Verse 3
Where we that wondrous hour
Shall see Him face to face.

Verse 4
O hasten Thine appearing,
Thou bright and Morning Star!

Verse 4
Lord, may we soon be hearing
The trumpet sound afar;

Verse 4
Thy people all are yearning
To be Thy raptured bride,

Verse 4
And at Thine own returning
Be caught up to Thy side.
