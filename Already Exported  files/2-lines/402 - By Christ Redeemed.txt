402 - By Christ Redeemed

Verse 1
By Christ redeemed, In Christ restored,
We keep the memory adored,

Verse 1
And show the death of our dear Lord,
Until He come.

Verse 2
His broken body in our stead Is here,
In this memorial bread;

Verse 2
And so our feeble love is fed,
Until He come.

Verse 3
His fearful drops of agony,
His life blood shed for us we see;

Verse 3
The wine shall tell the mystery,
Until He come.

Verse 4
And thus that dark betrayal night,
With the last advent unite----

Verse 4
The shame, the glory, by this rite,
Until He come.
