638 - The Wise May Bring Their Learning

Verse 1
wise may bring their learning,
The rich may bring their wealth,

Verse 1
And some may bring their greatness,
And some their strength and health:

Verse 1
We too would bring our treasures
To offer to the King,

Verse 1
We have no wealth or learning---
What shall we children bring?

Verse 2
We'll bring Him hearts that love Him,
We'll bring Him thankful praise,

Verse 2
And young souls meekly striving
To follow in His ways:

Verse 2
And these be the treasures
We offer to the King,

Verse 2
And these are gifts that ever
The poorest child may bring.

Verse 3
We'll bring the little duties
We have to do each day;

Verse 3
We'll try our best to please Him
At home, at school, at play:

Verse 3
And better are these treasures
To offer to the King

Verse 3
Than richest gift without them:
Yet these a child may bring.
