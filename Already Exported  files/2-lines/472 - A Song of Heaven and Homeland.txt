Intro
472 - A Song of Heaven and Homeland

Verse 1
Sometimes I hear strange music,
Like none e'er heard before,

Verse 1
Come floating softly earthward
As thro' heav'n's open door:

Verse 1
It seems like angel voices,
In strains of and love,

Verse 1
That swell the mighty chorus
Around the throne above.

Chorus
O sweet, celestial music,
Heard from a land afar-

Chorus
The song of Heav'n and Homeland,
Thro' doors God leaves ajar!

Verse 2
Now soft, and low, and restful,
It floods my soul with peace,

Verse 2
As if God's benediction
Bade all earth's troubles cease.

Verse 2
Then grander than the voices,
Of wind, and wave, and sea-

Verse 2
It fills the dome of heaven
With glorious harmony.

Chorus
O sweet, celestial music,
Heard from a land afar-

Chorus
The song of Heav'n and Homeland,
Thro' doors God leaves ajar!

Verse 3
This music haunts me ever,
Like something heard in dreams-

Verse 3
It seems to catch the cadence
Of heav'nly winds and streams,

Verse 3
My heart is filled with rapture,
To think, some day to come,

Verse 3
I'll sing it with the angels-
The song of heav'n and home.

Chorus
O sweet, celestial music,
Heard from a land afar-

Chorus
The song of Heav'n and Homeland,
Thro' doors God leaves ajar!
