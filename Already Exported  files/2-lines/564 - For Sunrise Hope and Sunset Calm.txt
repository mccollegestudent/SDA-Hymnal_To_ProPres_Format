564 - For Sunrise Hope and Sunset Calm

Verse 1
For sunrise hope and sunset calm, and all that lies between,
For all the sweetness and the balm that is and that has been,

Verse 1
For comradeship for peace in strife, and light on darkened days;
For work to do and strength for life we sing our hymn of praise.

Verse 2
But O, we press far, far above these gifts of pure delight,
And find in Thee, and in Thy love contentment infinite.

Verse 2
O Lord, beloved, in whom are found all joys of time and place,
What will it be when joy is crowned by vision of Thy face?
