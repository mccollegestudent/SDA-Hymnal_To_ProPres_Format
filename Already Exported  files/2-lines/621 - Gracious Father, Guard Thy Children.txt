621 - Gracious Father, Guard Thy Children

Verse 1
Gracious Father, guard Thy children
From the foe's destructive power;

Verse 1
Save, O save them, Lord, from falling
In this dark and trying hour.

Verse 1
Thou wilt surely prove Thy people,
All our graces must be tried;

Verse 1
But Thy word illumes our pathway,
And in God we still confide.

Verse 2
We are in the time of waiting;
Soon we shall behold our Lord,

Verse 2
Wafted far away from sorrow,
To receive our rich reward.

Verse 2
Keep us, Lord, till Thine appearing,
Pure, unspotted from the world;

Verse 2
Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us
Till Thy banner is unfurled.

Verse 3
With what joyful exultation
Shall the saints Thy banner see,

Verse 3
When the Lord for whom we've waited
Shall proclaim the jubilee!

Verse 3
Freedom from this world's pollutions;
Freedom from all sin and pain;

Verse 3
Freedom from the wiles of Satan,
And from death's destructive reign.
