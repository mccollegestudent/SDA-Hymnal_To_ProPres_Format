357 - Come, Labor On

Verse 1
Come, labor on.
Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain

Verse 1
While all around him waves the golden grain?
And to each servant does the Master say,

Verse 1
"Go work today."

Verse 2
Come, labor on.
Claim the high calling angels cannot share;

Verse 2
To young and old the gospel gladness bear;
Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.

Verse 2
The night draws nigh.

Verse 3
Come, labor on.
No time for rest; till glows the western sky,

Verse 3
Till the long shadows o√©r our pathway lie,
And a glad sound comes with the setting sun,

Verse 3
"Well done, well done!"
