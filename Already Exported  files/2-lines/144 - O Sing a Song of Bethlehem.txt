144 - O Sing a Song of Bethlehem

Verse 1
O sing a song of Bethlehem,
Of shepherds watching there,

Verse 1
And of the news that came to them
From angels in the air:

Verse 1
The light that shone on Bethlehem
Fills all the world today;

Verse 1
Of Jesus'birth and peace on earth
The angels sing alway.

Verse 2
O sing a song of Nazareth,
Of sunny days of joy,

Verse 2
O sing of fragrant flowers breath,
And of the sinless Boy:

Verse 2
For now the flowers of Nazareth
In every heart may grow;

Verse 2
Now spreads the fame of His dear name
On all the winds that blow.

Verse 3
O sing a song of Calvary,
Its glory and dismay;

Verse 3
Of Him who hung upon the tree,
And took our sins away:

Verse 3
For He who died on Calvary
Is risen from the grave;

Verse 3
And Christ, our Lord, by heaven adored,
Is mighty now to save.
