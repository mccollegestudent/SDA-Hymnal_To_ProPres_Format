080 - O World of God

Verse 1
O world of God, so vast and strange,
profound and wonderful and fair,

Verse 1
Beyond the utmost reach of thought,
but not beyond a Father's care!

Verse 1
We are not strangers on this earth
whirling amid the suns of space;

Verse 1
We are God's children, this our home,
with those of every clime and race.

Verse 2
O world of man where life is lived,
so strangely mingling joy and pain,

Verse 2
So full of evil and of good,
so needful that the good shall reign!

Verse 2
It is this world that God has loved,
and goodness was its Maker's plan,

Verse 2
The promise of God's triumph is
His coming in a Son of Man.

Verse 3
O world of time's farstretching years!
there was a day when time stood still,

Verse 3
A central moment when there rose
across upon a cruel hill;

Verse 3
In pain and death love's power was seen,
the mystery of time revealed,

Verse 3
The wisdom of the ways of God,
the grace through which man's hurt is healed.
