048 - Softly Now the Light of Day

Verse 1
Softly now the light of day
Fades upon out sight away:

Verse 1
Free from care, from labor free,
Lord, we would commune with Thee.

Verse 2
Thou, whose allpervading eye
Nought escapes, without, within,

Verse 2
Pardon each infirmity,
Open fault, and secret sin.

Verse 3
Soon from us the light of day
Shall forever pass away;

Verse 3
Then, from sin and sorrow free,
Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.
