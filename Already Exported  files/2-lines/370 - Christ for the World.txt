370 - Christ for the World

Verse 1
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,

Verse 1
with loving zeal;
the poor, and them that mourn,

Verse 1
the faint and overborne,
sinsick and sorrow-worn,

Verse 1
whom Christ doth heal.

Verse 2
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,

Verse 2
with fervent prayer;
the wayward and the lost,

Verse 2
by restless passions tossed,
redeemed at countless cost,

Verse 2
from dark despair.

Verse 3
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,

Verse 3
with joyful song;
the newborn souls, whose days,

Verse 3
reclaimed from error's ways,
inspired with hope and praise,

Verse 3
to Christ belong.
