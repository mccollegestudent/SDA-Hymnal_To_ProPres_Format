159 - The Old Rugged Cross

Verse 1
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
the emblem of suffering and shame;

Verse 1
and I love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain.

Chorus
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;

Chorus
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.

Verse 2
O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
has a wondrous attraction for me;

Verse 2
for the dear Lamb of God left his glory above
to bear it to dark Calvary.

Chorus
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;

Chorus
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.

Verse 3
To that old rugged cross I will ever be true,
its shame and reproach gladly bear;

Verse 3
then he'll call me some day to my home far away,
where his glory forever I'll share.

Chorus
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;

Chorus
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.
