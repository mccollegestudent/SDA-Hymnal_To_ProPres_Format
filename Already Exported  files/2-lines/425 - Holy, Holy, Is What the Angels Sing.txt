425 - Holy, Holy, Is What the Angels Sing

Verse 1
There is singing up in heaven
such as we have never known,

Verse 1
Where the angels sing the praises
of the Lamb upon the throne;

Verse 1
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful
and their voices are always clear,

Verse 1
O that we might be more like them
while we serve the Master here!

Chorus
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make

Chorus
the courts of heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story,

Chorus
they will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys

Chorus
that our salvation brings.

Verse 2
But I hear another anthem,
blending voices clear and strong,

Verse 2
"Unto Him who hath redeemed us
and hath bought us," is the song;

Verse 2
We have come thro' tribulations
to this land so fair and bright,

Verse 2
In the fountain freely flowing
He hath made our garments white.

Chorus
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make

Chorus
the courts of heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story,

Chorus
they will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys

Chorus
that our salvation brings.

Verse 3
Then the angels stand and listen,
for they cannot join that song,

Verse 3
Like the sound of many waters,
by that happy, blood-washed throng;

Verse 3
For they sing about great trials,
battles fought and vict'ries won,

Verse 3
And they praised the great Redeemer,
who hath said to them, "Well done."

Chorus
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make

Chorus
the courts of heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story,

Chorus
they will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys

Chorus
that our salvation brings.

Verse 4
So, although I'm not an angel,
yet I know that over there

Verse 4
I will join  a blessed chorus
that the angels cannot share;

Verse 4
I will sing about my Savior,
who upon dark Calvary

Verse 4
Freely pardoned my transgressions,
died to set the sinner free.

Chorus
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make

Chorus
the courts of heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story,

Chorus
they will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys

Chorus
that our salvation brings.
