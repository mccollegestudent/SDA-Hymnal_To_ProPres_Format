140 - Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne

Verse 1
Thou didst leave Thy throne
And Thy kingly crown

Verse 1
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home

Verse 1
Was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity.

Chorus
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Verse 2
Heaven's arches rang
When the angels sang

Verse 2
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth

Verse 2
Didst Thou come to earth,
And in greatest humility.

Chorus
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Verse 3
The foxes found rest,
And the birds their nest

Verse 3
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod,

Verse 3
O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee.

Chorus
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Verse 4
Thou camest, O Lord,
With the living word

Verse 4
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn,

Verse 4
And with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary.

Chorus
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Verse 5
When the heavens shall ring,
And the angels sing,

Verse 5
At Thy coming to victory,
Let Thy voice call me home,

Verse 5
Saying, "Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee."

Chorus
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,
When Thou comest and callest for me.
