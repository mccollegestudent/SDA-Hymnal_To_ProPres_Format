Intro
526 - Because He Lives

Verse 1
God sent His Son, they called His Jesus,
He came to love, heal, and forgive;

Verse 1
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.

Chorus
Because He lives I can face tomorrow,
Because He lives all fear is gone;

Chorus
Because I know He holds the future.
And life is worth the living just because He lives.

Verse 2
How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
And feel the pride, and joy He gives;

Verse 2
But greater still the calm assurance,
This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

Chorus
Because He lives I can face tomorrow,
Because He lives all fear is gone;

Chorus
Because I know He holds the future.
And life is worth the living just because He lives.
