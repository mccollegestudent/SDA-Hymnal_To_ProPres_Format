The hour is hastening on;

Far brighter than the sun;

The Savior will appear,

To meet Him in the air.

Will go to meet their Lord;

Will then be their reward;

Will wipe all tears away;

Nor clouds nor night remaining,
But one eternal day.

O Christian, keep from sleeping,
And let your love abound;

Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,
The trumpet soon will sound!

O sinner, hear the warning!
To Jesus quickly!

Then you, in that blest morning,
May meet Him in the sky!
