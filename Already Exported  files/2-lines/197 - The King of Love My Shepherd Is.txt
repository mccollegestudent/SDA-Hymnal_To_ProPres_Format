197 - The King of Love My Shepherd Is

Verse 1
The King of love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never;

Verse 1
I nothing lack if I am His,
And He is mine forever.

Verse 2
Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth,

Verse 2
And, where the verdant pastures grow,
With food celestial feedeth.

Verse 3
Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,
But yet in love He sought me,

Verse 3
And on His shoulder gently laid,
And home, rejoicing, brought me.

Verse 4
And so through all the length of days
Thy goodness faileth never;

Verse 4
Good Shepherd! I would sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forever.
