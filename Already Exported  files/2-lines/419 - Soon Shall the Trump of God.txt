419 - Soon Shall the Trump of God

Verse 1
Soon shall the trump of God
Give out the welcome sound,

Verse 1
That shakes death's silent chamber walls,
And breaks the turf sealed ground.

Verse 2
You dwellers in the dust,
Awake, come forth, and sing;

Verse 2
Sharp has your frost of winter been,
But bright shall be your spring.

Verse 3
'Twas sown in weakness here;
'Twill then be raised in power;

Verse 3
That which was sown in earthly seed  
Shall rise a heav'nly flower.
