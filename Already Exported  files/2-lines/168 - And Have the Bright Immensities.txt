Verse 1
And have the bright immensities
Received our risen Lord,

Verse 1
Where light years frame the Pleiades
And point Orion's sword?

Verse 1
Do flaming suns His footsteps trace
Thro'corridors sublime,

Verse 1
The Lord of inter stellar space
And conqueror of time?

Verse 2
The heav'n that hides Him from our sight
Knows neither near nor far;

Verse 2
A little candle sheds its light
As surely as a star.

Verse 2
And where His loving people meet
To share the gift divine,

Verse 2
There stands He with unhurrying feet;
There heav'nly splendors shine.
