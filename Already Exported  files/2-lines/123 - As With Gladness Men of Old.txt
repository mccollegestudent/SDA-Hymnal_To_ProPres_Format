123 - As With Gladness Men of Old

Verse 1
As with gladness men of old
Did the guiding star behold,

Verse 1
As with joy they hailed its light,
Leading onward, beaming bright,

Verse 1
So, most gracious Lord, may we
Evermore be led to Thee.

Verse 2
As with joyful steps they sped
To that lowly manger bed,

Verse 2
There to bend the knee before
Him whom heav’n and earth adore,

Verse 2
So may we with willing feet
Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

Verse 3
As they offered gifts most rare
At that manger rude and bare,

Verse 3
So may we with holy joy,
Pure, and free from sin’s alloy,

Verse 3
All our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee our heav’nly King.

Verse 4
Holy Jesus, every day
Keep us in the narrow way;

Verse 4
And, when earthly things are past,
Bring our ransomed souls at last

Verse 4
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
