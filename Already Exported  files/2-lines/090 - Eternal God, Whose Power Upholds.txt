090 - Eternal God, Whose Power Upholds

Verse 1
Eternal God, whose power upholds Both flower and flaming star,
To whom there is no here nor there, No time, no near nor far,

Verse 1
No alien race, no foreign shore, No child unsought, unknown:
O send us forth, Your prophets true, To make all lands Your own!

Verse 2
O God of truth, whom science seeks And reverent souls adore,
Illumine every earnest mind Of every clime and shore:

Verse 2
Dispel the gloom of error's night, Of ignorance and fear,
Until true wisdom from above Shall make life's pathway clear!

Verse 3
O God of beauty, oft revealed In dreams of human art,
In speech that flows to melody, In holiness of heart:

Verse 3
Teach us to ban al ugliness, And all disharmony,
Till all shall know the loveliness Of lives made fair and free!

Verse 4
O God of righteousness and grace, Seen in the Christ, Your Son,
Whose life and death reveal Your face, By whom Your will was done;

Verse 4
Help us to spread Your gracious reign Till greed and hate shall cease,
And kindness dwell in human hearts, And all the earth find peace!
