Christ is the world's true light,
Its captain of salvation,

The daystar clear and bright
Of every man and nation;

New life, new hope awakes
Where'er men own His sway:

Freedom her bondage breaks,
And night is turned to day.

In Christ all races meet,
Their ancient feuds forgeting,

Verse 2
The whole round world complete,
From sunrise to its setting:

When Christ is throned as Lord,
Men shall forsake their fear,

Verse 2
To plowshare beat the sword,
To pruning hook the spear.

One Lord, in one great name
Unite us all who own Thee,

Verse 3
Cast out our pride and shame
That hinder to enthrone Thee;

Verse 3
The world has waited long,
Has travailed long in pain,

To heal its ancient wrong,
Come, Prince of Peace, and reign.
