Is this a day of new beginnings,
Time to remember and move on,

Verse 1
Time too believe what love is bringing,
Laying to rest the pain that's gone?

Verse 2
How can the seasons of a planet
Mindlessly spinning round its sun

Verse 2
With just a human name and number
Say that some new thing has begun?

Yet through the life and death of Jesus
Love's mighty Spirit, now as then,

Verse 3
Can make for us a world of difference
As faith and hope are born again.

Verse 4
Then let us, with the Spirit's daring,
Step from the past and leave behind

Verse 4
Its disappointment, guilt, and grieving,
Seeking new paths, and sure to find.

Verse 5
Christ is alive, and goes before us
To show and share what love can do.

Verse 5
This is a day of new beginnings;
Our God is making all things new.
