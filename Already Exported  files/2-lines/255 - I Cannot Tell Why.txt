255 - I Cannot Tell Why

Verse 1
I cannot tell why He whom angels worship
Should set His love upon the souls of men,

Verse 1
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers,
To bring them back, they know not how nor when.

Verse 1
But this I know that He was born of Mary
When Bethlehem's manger was His only home,

Verse 1
And that He lived at Nazareth and labored;
And so the Savior, Savior of the world, has come.

Verse 2
I cannot tell how silently He suffered
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,

Verse 2
Nor how His heart upon the cross was broken,
The crown of pain to three and thirty years.

Verse 2
But this I know He heals the broken hearted
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear,

Verse 2
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden;
For still the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.

Verse 3
I cannot tell how He will win the nations,
How He will claim His earthly heritage,

Verse 3
How satisfy the needs and aspirations
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.

Verse 3
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory,
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,

Verse 3
And some glad day His sun will shine in splendor
When He the Savior, Savior of the world, is known.

Verse 4
I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,
When at His bidding every storm is stilled,

Verse 4
Or who can say how great the jubilation
When all our hearts with love for Him are filled.

Verse 4
But this I know the skies shall sound His praises,
Ten thousand thousand human voices sing,

Verse 4
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth will answer,
At last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King!
