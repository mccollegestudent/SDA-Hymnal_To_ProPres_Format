Binding all the Church in one;

Holy Zion's help forever
And our confidence alone.

To this temple where we call You,
Come, O Lord of hosts, and stay;

Hear Your people as they pray;

And Your fullest benediction
Shed within these walls today.

All the gifts they ask to gain;

With the blessed to retain;

And hereafter in Your glory
Evermore with You to reign.

Praise and honor to the Father,
Praise and honor to the Son,

Ever three and ever one:

One in might and one in glory
While unending ages run!
