005 - All My Hope on God is Founded

Verse 1
All my hope on God is founded;
He doth still my trust renew,

Verse 1
Me through change and chance He guideth,
Only good and only true.

Verse 1
God unknown, He alone 
Calls my heart to be His own.

Verse 2
Pride of man and earthly glory,
Sword and crown betray his trust;

Verse 2
What with care and toil he buildeth,
Tower and temple fall to dust.

Verse 2
But God's power, hour to hour, 
Is my temple and my tower.

Verse 3
God's great goodness aye endureth,
Deep His wisdom, passing thought:

Verse 3
Splendour, light, and life attend Him,
Beauty springeth out of naught.

Verse 3
Love doth stand at His hand; 
Joy doth wait on His command.

Verse 4
Still from man to God eternal
Sacrifice of praise be done,

Verse 4
High above all praises praising
For the gift of Christ His Son.

Verse 4
Christ doth call one and all;  
Ye who follow shall not fall.
