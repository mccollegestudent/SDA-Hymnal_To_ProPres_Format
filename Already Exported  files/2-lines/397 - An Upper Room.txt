An upper room did our Lord prepare
For those loved until the end:

To celebrate their risen Friend.

For service, too, is sacrament.

In Him our joy shall be made complete
Sent out to serve, as He was sent.

To share His bread, His loving cup.

Whatever burdens may bow us down,
He by His cross shall lift us up.

He loves beyond our uttermost:

In every room in our Father's house,
He will be there, as Lord and host.
