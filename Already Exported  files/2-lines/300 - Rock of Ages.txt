Intro
300 - Rock of Ages

Verse 1
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;

Verse 1
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,

Verse 1
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

Verse 2
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law's demands;

Verse 2
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,

Verse 2
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Verse 3
When my pilgrimage I close;
Victor o'er the last of foes,

Verse 3
When I soar to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

Verse 3
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
