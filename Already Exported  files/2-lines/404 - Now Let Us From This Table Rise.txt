Renewed in body, mind, and soul;

His selfless love has made us whole.

To spread the word in speech and deed,

We follow in the steps of Christ,
At one with all in hope and need.

It is the sacrament of care;

We humbly pledge ourselves to share.

To choose again the pilgrim way

And help us to accept with joy
The challenge of tomorrow's day.
