Verse 1
Loving Shepherd of Thy sheep,
Keep Thy lamb, in safety keep;

Nothing can Thy power withstand;
None can pluck me from Thy hand.

Loving Shepherd, ever near,
Teach Thy lamb Thy voice to hear;

Verse 2
Suffer not my steps to stray
From the straight and narrow way.

Where Thou leadest I would go,
Walking in Thy steps below,

Verse 3
Till within the heavenly fold
I my Shepherd shall behold.
