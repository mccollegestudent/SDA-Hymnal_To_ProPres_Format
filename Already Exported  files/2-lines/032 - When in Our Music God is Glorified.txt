When in our music God is glorified,
And adoration leaves no room for pride,

Alleluia! Alleluia!

A new dimension in the world of sound,

As worship moved us to a more profound
Alleluia! Alleluia!

When utmost evil strove against the light?

Then let us sing for whom He won the fight:
Alleluia! Alleluia!

Let every instrument be used for praise;
Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise;

Alleluia! Alleluia!
