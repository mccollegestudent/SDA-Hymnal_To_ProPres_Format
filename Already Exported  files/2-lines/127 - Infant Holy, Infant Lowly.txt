For His bed a cattle stall;

Christ the babe is Lord of all;

Noels ringing, tidings bringing,

Christ the babe is Lord of all,
Christ the babe is Lord of all.

Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping
Vigil till the morning new;

Saw the glory, heard the story,
Tidings of the gospel true;

Praising voicing greet the morrow,

Christ the babe was born for you,
Christ the babe was born for you.
