096 - The Spacious Firmament

Verse 1
The spacious firmament on high,
With all the blue, ethereal sky, 

Verse 1
And spangled heavens, a shining frame, 
Their great Original proclaim. 

Verse 1
Th'unwearied sun from day to day 
Does his Creator's power display, 

Verse 1
And publishes to every land 
The work of an almighty hand

Verse 2
Soon as the evening shades prevail,
The moon takes up the wondrous tale;

Verse 2
And nightly to the listening earth 
Repeats the story of her birth;

Verse 2
While all the stars that round her burn, 
And all the planets in their turn,

Verse 2
Confirm the tidings as they roll,
And spread the truth from pole to pole

Verse 3
What though in solemn silence all 
Move round the dark terrestrial ball?

Verse 3
What though no real voice nor sound 
Amid their radiant orbs be found?

Verse 3
In reason's ear they all rejoice
And utter forth a glorious voice,

Verse 3
Forever singing as they shine,
"The hand that made us is divine."
