493 - Fill My Cup, Lord

Verse 1
Like the woman at the well I was seeking
For things that could not satisfy:

Verse 1
And then I heard my Savior speaking:
" Draw from my well that never shall run dry".

Chorus
Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;

Chorus
Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more--
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!

Verse 2
There are millions in this world who are craving
The pleasures earthly things afford;

Verse 2
But none can match the wondrous treasure
That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

Chorus
Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;

Chorus
Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more--
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!

Verse 3
So, my brother, if the things this world gave you
Leave hungers that won't pass away,

Verse 3
My blessed Lord will come and save you,
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:

Chorus
Fill my cup Lord, I lift it up, Lord!
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;

Chorus
Bread of heaven, Feed me till I want no more--
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
