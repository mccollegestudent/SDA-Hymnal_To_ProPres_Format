488 - At First I Prayed for Light

Verse 1
At first I prayed for light:
Could I but see the way,

Verse 1
How gladly, swiftly would I walk
To everlasting day!

Verse 2
And next I prayed for strength:
That I might tread the road

Verse 2
With firm, unfaltering feet, and win
The heaven's serene abode.

Verse 3
And then I asked for faith:
Could I but trust my God,

Verse 3
I'd live infolded in His peace,
Though foes were all abroad.

Verse 4
But now I pray for love:
Deep love to God and man;

Verse 4
A living love that will not fail,
However dark His plan.

Verse 5
And light and strength and faith
Are opening everywhere!

Verse 5
God waited patiently until
I prayed the larger prayer.
