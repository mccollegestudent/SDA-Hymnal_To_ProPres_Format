Verse 1
As water to the thirsty,
As beauty to the eyes,

As strength that follows weakness,
As truth instead of lies;

As songtime and springtime and summertime to be,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,

Verse 1
So is my Lord to me.

Verse 2
Like calm in place of clamor
Like peace that follows pain,

Verse 2
Like meeting after parting,
Like sunshine after rain;

Verse 2
Like moonlight and starlight and sunlight on the sea,
So is my Lord, my living Lord,

Verse 2
So is my Lord to me.

Verse 3
As sleep that follows fever,
As gold instead of grey,

Verse 3
As freedom after bondage,
As sunrise to the day;

Verse 3
As home to the trav'ler and all he longs to see,
So is my Lord, my Living Lord to me.
