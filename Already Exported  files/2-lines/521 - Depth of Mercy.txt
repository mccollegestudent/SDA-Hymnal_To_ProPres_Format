Verse 1
Depth of mercy!--can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?

Verse 1
Can my God His wrath forbear?
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

Verse 2
I have long withstood His grace,
Long provoked Him to His face,

Verse 2
Would not hearken to His calls,
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.

Verse 3
Now incline me to repent;
Let me now my sins lament;

Verse 3
Now my foul revolt deplore,
Weep, believe, and sin no more.

Verse 4
There for me the Savior stands,
Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;

Verse 4
God is love! I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
