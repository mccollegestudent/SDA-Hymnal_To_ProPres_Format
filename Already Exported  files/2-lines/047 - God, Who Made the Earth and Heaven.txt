Verse 1
God, who made the earth and heaven, Darkness and light:
You the day for work have given, For rest the night.

Verse 1
May Your angel guards defend us,
Slumber sweet Your mercy send us,

Verse 1
Holy dreams and hopes attend us
All through the night.

Verse 2
And when morn again shall call us to run life's way,
May we still, what-e'er befall us, Your will obey.

Verse 2
From the pow'r of evil hide us,
In the narrow pathway guide us,

Verse 2
Never be Your smile denied us
All through the day.

Verse 3
Guard us waking, guard us sleeping, And, when we die,
May we in Your mighty keeping All peaceful lie.

Verse 3
When the trumpet call shall wake us, Then,
O Lord, do not forsake us,

Verse 3
But to reign in glory take us with You on high.

Verse 4
Holy Father, throned in heaven, All holy Son,
Holy Spirit, freely given, Blest Three in One:

Verse 4
Grant us grace, we now implore You,
Till we lay our crowns before You

Verse 4
And in worthier strains adore You while ages run.
