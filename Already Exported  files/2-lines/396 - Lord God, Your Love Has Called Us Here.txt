396 - Lord God, Your Love Has Called Us Here

Verse 1
Lord God, Your love has called us here,
As we, by love, for love were made.

Verse 1
Your living likeness still we bear
Tho'marred, dishonored, disobeyed.

Verse 1
We come, with all our heart and mind
Your call to hear, Your love to find.

Verse 2
We come with self inflicted pains
Of broken trust and chosen wrong,

Verse 2
Half free, half bound by inner chains,
By social forces swept along,

Verse 2
By powers and systems close confined,
Yet seeking hope for human kind.

Verse 3
Lord God, in Christ You call our name,
And then receive us as Your own,

Verse 3
Not thro' some merit, right, or claim,
But by Your gracious love alone.

Verse 3
We strain to glimpse Your mercy seat,
And find You kneeling at our feet.

Verse 4
Then take the towel, and break the bread,
And humble us, and call us friends.

Verse 4
Suffer and serve till all are fed
And show how grandly love intends

Verse 4
To work till all creation sings,
To fill all worlds, to crown all things.

Verse 5
Lord God, in Christ You set us free
Your life to live, Your joy to share.

Verse 5
Give us Your Spirit's liberty
To turn from guilt and dull despair

Verse 5
And offer all that faith can do,
While love is making all things new.
