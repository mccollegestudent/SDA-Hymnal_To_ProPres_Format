283 - O Jesus, Thou Art Standing

Verse 1
O Jesus, thou art standing,
outside the fast closed door,

Verse 1
in lowly patience waiting
to pass the threshold o'er:

Verse 1
O shame, professing Christians,
his Name and sign who bear,

Verse 1
O shame, thrice shame upon us,
to keep him standing there!

Verse 2
O Jesus, thou art knocking;
and lo, that hand is scarred,

Verse 2
and thorns thy brow encircle,
and tears thy face have marred:

Verse 2
O love that passeth knowledge,
so patiently to wait!

Verse 2
O sin that hath no equal,
so fast to bar the gate!

Verse 3
O Jesus, thou art pleading
in accents meek and low,

Verse 3
"I died for you, my children,
and will you treat me so?"

Verse 3
O Lord, with shame and sorrow
we open now the door;

Verse 3
dear Savior, enter, enter,
and leave us never more.
