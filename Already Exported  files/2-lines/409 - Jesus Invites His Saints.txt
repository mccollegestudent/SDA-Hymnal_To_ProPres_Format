Verse 1
Jesus invites His saints
To meet around His board,

Verse 1
And sup in memory of the death
And sufferings of their Lord.

Verse 2
We take the bread and wine
As emblems of Thy death;

Verse 2
Lord, raise our souls above the sign,
To feast on Thee by faith.

Verse 2
Faith eats the bread of life,
And drinks the living wine;

Verse 2
It looks beyond this scene of strife
Unites us to the Vine.

Verse 4
Soon shall the night be gone,
Our Lord will come again;

Verse 4
The marriage supper of the Lamb
Will usher in His reign.
