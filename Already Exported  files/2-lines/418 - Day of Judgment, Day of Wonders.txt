Verse 1
Day of judgement, day of wonders!
Hark the trumpet's awful sound,

Verse 1
Louder than a thousand thunders,
Shakes the vast creation round!

Verse 1
How the summons
Will the sinner's heart confound!

Verse 2
See the Lord in the glory nearing,
Clothed in majesty divine,

Verse 2
You who long for His appearing,
Then shall say, "This God is mine!"

Verse 2
Gracious Savior, Gracious Savior,
Own me in that day as Thine.

Verse 3
At His call the dead awaken,
Rise to life form earth and sea!

Verse 3
All the powers of nature shaken
By His looks prepare to flee.

Verse 3
Careless sinner, Careless sinner,
What will then become of thee?

Verse 4
But to those who have confessed
Loved and served the Lord below,

Verse 4
He will say, "Come near, ye blessed,
See the kingdom I bestow;

Verse 4
You forever, You forever
Shall my love and glory know."
