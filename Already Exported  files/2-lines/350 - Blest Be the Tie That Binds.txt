Verse 1
Blest be the tie that binds
our hearts in Christian love;

Verse 1
the fellowship of kindred minds
is like to that above.

Verse 2
Before our Father's throne
we pour our ardent prayers;

Verse 2
our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
our comforts and our cares.

Verse 3
We share each other's woes,
our mutual burdens bear;

Verse 3
and often for each other flows
the sympathizing tear.

Verse 4
When we asunder part,
it gives us inward pain;

Verse 4
but we shall still be joined in heart,
and hope to meet again.
