129 - As It Fell Upon a Night

Verse 1
As it fell upon a night
In the winter weather,

Verse 1
Angels bright in starry height
Began to sing together.

Verse 2
Shepherds sleeping on the plain
Woke to see the glory,

Verse 2
All amazed they stood and gazed
And heard the angels' story.

Verse 3
Unto you a child is born
In a manger lowly,

Verse 3
Humble, He, yet born to be
The King of Love most holy.

Verse 4
Happy angels from afar,
Cease your singing never!

Verse 4
In excelsis gloria!
For ever and for ever.
