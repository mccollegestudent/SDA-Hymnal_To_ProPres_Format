Thy head upon My breast."

Weary and worn and sad;

And He has made me glad.

"Behold, I freely give

Verse 2
The living water; thirsty one,
Stoop down and drink and live."

Of that life giving stream;

My thirst was quench'd, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.

"I am this dark world's light;

Verse 3
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright."

In Him my star, my sun;

Verse 3
And in that light of  life I'll walk,
Till trav'ling  days are done.
