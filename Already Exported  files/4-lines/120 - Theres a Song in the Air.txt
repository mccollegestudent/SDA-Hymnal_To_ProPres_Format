120 - There's a Song in the Air

Verse 1
There's a song in the air!
There's a star in the sky!
There's a mother's deep prayer
And a baby's low cry!

Verse 1
And the star rains its fire
while the beautiful sing,
For the manger of Bethlehem
cradles a King!

Verse 2
There's a tumult of joy
O'er the wonderful birth,
For the virgin's sweet boy
Is the Lord of the earth.

Verse 2
Aye! the star rains its fire
while the beautiful sing,
For the manger of Bethlehem
cradles a King!

Verse 3
In the light of that star
Lie the ages impearled;
And that song from afar
Has swept over the world.

Verse 3
Every hearth is aflame
and the beautiful sing
In the homes of the nations
that Jesus is King!

Verse 4
We rejoice in the light,
And we echo the song
That comes down through the night
From the heavenly throng.

Verse 4
Aye! we shout to the lovely evangel they bring,
And we greet in His cradle
our Savior and King!
