131 - Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming

Verse 1
Lo, how a rose e're blooming 
From tenderstem hath sprung,
Of Jesse's lineage coming 
As men of old have sung.

Verse 1
It came, a floweret bright, 
Amid the cold of winter
When half spent was the night.

Verse 2
Isaiah 'twas foretold it, 
The Rose I have in mind,
With Mary we beheld it, 
The virgin mother kind.

Verse 2
To show God's love aright 
She bore to them a Savior,
When half spent was the night.
