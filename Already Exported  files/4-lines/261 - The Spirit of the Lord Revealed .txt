261 - The Spirit of the Lord Revealed 

Verse 1
The Spirit of the Lord revealed
His will to saints of old;
Their heart and mind lips unsealed
His glory to unfold.

Verse 1
Amid the gloom of ancient night
They hailed the dawning Word,
And in the coming of the light
Proclaimed the coming Lord.

Verse 2
The prophets passed; at length there came
To sojourn and abide,
The Word incarnate, to whose name
The prophets testified;

Verse 2
And He, the twilight overpast,
Himself, the Light of light,
As man with man, revealed at last
The Father to our sight.

Verse 3
Eternal Spirit, who dost speak
To mind and conscience still,
That we in this our day, may seek
To do our Father's will,

Verse 3
To us the word of life impart,
Of Christ, the living way;
Give us the quiet, humble heart
To hear and to obey.
