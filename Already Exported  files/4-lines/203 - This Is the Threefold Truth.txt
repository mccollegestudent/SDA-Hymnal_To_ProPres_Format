203 - This Is the Threefold Truth

Verse 1
This is the threefold truth
On which our faith depends;
And with this joyful cry
Worship begins and ends.

Chorus
Christ had died! Christ has risen!
Christ will come again!

Verse 2
By this we are upheld 
When doubt and grief assail
Our Christian fortitude 
And only grace avails

Chorus
Christ had died! Christ has risen!
Christ will come again!

Verse 3
This is the threefold truth 
Which, if we hold it fast,
Changes the world and us 
And brings us home at last.

Chorus
Christ had died! Christ has risen!
Christ will come again!
