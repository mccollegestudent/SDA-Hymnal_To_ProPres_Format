359 - Hark! the Voice of Jesus Calling

Verse 1
Hark! the voice of Jesus calling,
"Who will go and work today?
Fields are white, the harvest waiting,
Who will bear the sheaves away?"

Verse 1
Loud and long the Master calleth,
Rich reward He offers free;
Who will answer, gladly saying,
"Here am I, O Lord, send me"?

Verse 2
If you cannot cross the ocean
And the heathen lands explore,
You can find the heathen nearer,
You can help them at your door;

Verse 2
If you cannot speak like angels,
If you cannot preach like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus,
You can say He died for all.

Verse 3
If you cannot be the watchman,
Standing high on Zion's wall,
Pointing out the path to heaven,
Offering life and peace to all;

Verse 3
With your prayers and with your bounties
You can do what Heaven demands,
You can be like faithful Aaron,
Holding up the prophet's hands.

Verse 4
While the souls of men are dying,
And the Master calls for you,
Let none hear you idly saying,
"There is nothing I can do!"

Verse 4
Gladly take the task He gives you,
Let His work your pleasure be;
Answer quickly when He calleth,
"Here am I, O Lord, send me."
