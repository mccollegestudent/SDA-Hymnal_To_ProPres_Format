087 - God Who Spoke in the Beginning

Verse 1
God who spoke in the beginning,
Forming rock and shaping spar,
Set all life and growth in motion,
Earthly world and distant star;

Verse 1
He who calls the earth to order
Is the ground of what we are.

Verse 2
God who spoke thro' men and nations,
Thro' events long past and gone,
Showing still today His purpose,
Speaks supremely through His Son;

Verse 2
He who calls the earth to order
Gives His word and it is done.

Verse 3
God whose speech becomes incarnate-
Christ is servant, Christ is Lord-
Calls us to a life of service,
Heart and will to action stirred;

Verse 3
He who uses man's obedience
Has the first and final word.
