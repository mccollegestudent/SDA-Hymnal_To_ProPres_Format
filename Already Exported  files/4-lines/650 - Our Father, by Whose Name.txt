650 - Our Father, by Whose Name

Verse 1
Our Father, by whose name,
All fatherhood is known,
Who dost in love proclaim
Each family Thine own,

Verse 1
Bless Thou all parents, guarding well,
With constant love as sentinel,
The homes in which Thy people dwell.

Verse 2
O Christ, Thyself a child
Within an earthly home,
With heart still undefiled,
Thou didst to manhood come;

Verse 2
Our children bless, in every place,
That they may all behold Thy face,
And knowing Thee may grow in grace.

Verse 3
O Spirit, who dost bind
Our hearts in unity,
Who teaches us to find
The love from self set free,

Verse 3
In all our hearts such love increase,
That every home, by this release,
May be dwelling place of peace.
