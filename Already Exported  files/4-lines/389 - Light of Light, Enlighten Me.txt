389 - Light of Light, Enlighten Me

Verse 1
Light of light, enlighten me,
Now anew the day is dawning;
Sun of grace, the shadows flee;
Brighten Thou my Sabbath morning;

Verse 1
With Thy joyous sunshine blest,
Happy is my day of rest.

Verse 2
Let me with my heart today,
Holy, holy, holy, singing,
Rapt awhile from earth away,
All my soul to Thee up springing,

Verse 2
Have a foretaste inward given
How they worship Thee in heaven.

Verse 3
Hence all care, all vanity!
For the day to God is holy;
Come, Thou glorious Majesty,
Deign to fill this temple lowly;

Verse 3
Nought today my soul shall move,
Simply resting in Thy love.
