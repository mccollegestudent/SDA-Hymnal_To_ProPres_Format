188 - My Song Is Love Unknown

Verse 1
My song is love unknown,
My Savior's love to me,
Love to the loveless shown,
That they might lovely be.

Verse 1
O who am I that for my sake
My Lord should take frail flesh and die?

Verse 2
He came from His blest throne,
Salvation to bestow,
But men made strange, and none
The longed for Christ would know.

Verse 2
But O my Friend, my Friend indeed
Who at my need His life did spend.

Verse 3
Sometimes they strew His way,
And His sweet praises sing,
Resounding all the day,
Hosannas to their King.

Verse 3
Then "Crucify" is all their breath,
And for His death they thirst and cry.

Verse 4
Why, what hath my Lord done?
What makes this rage and spite?
He made the lame to run,
He gave the blind their sight.

Verse 4
Sweet injuries! yet they at these
Themselves displease, and 'gainst Him rise.

Verse 5
They rise, and needs will have
My dear Lord made away;
A murderer they save,
The Prince of life they slay.

Verse 5
Yet cheerful He to suff'ring goes,
That He His foes from thence might free.

Verse 6
Here might I stay and sing,
No story so divine:
Never was love, dear King,
Never was grief like Thine!

Verse 6
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise
I all my days could gladly spend.
