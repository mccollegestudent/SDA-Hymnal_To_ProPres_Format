Jesus reigns, the God of love:

See, He sits on yonder throne;
Jesus rules the world alone.

King of glory, reign forever,
Thine an everlasting crown;
Nothing from Thy love shall sever
Those whom Thou hast made Thine own;

Happy objects of Thy grace,
Destined to behold Thy face.

Savior, hasten Thine appearing;
Bring, O bring the glorious day,
When, the awful summons hearing,
Heaven and earth shall pass away:;

Then, with golden harps we'll sing,
"Glory, glory to our King!"
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Amen.
