233 - Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies

Verse 1
Christ, whose glory fills the skies, 
Christ, the true, the only light, 
Sun of Righteousness, arise, 
triumph o'er the shades of night; 

Verse 1
Dayspring from on high, be near; 
Daystar, in my heart appear.

Verse 2
Dark and cheerless is the morn 
unaccompanied by thee; 
joyless is the day's return, 
till thy mercy's beams I see; 

Verse 2
till they inward light impart, 
cheer my eyes and warm my heart.

Verse 3
Visit then this soul of mine; 
pierce the gloom of sin and grief; 
fill me, Radiancy divine, 
scatter all my unbelief; 

Verse 3
more and more thyself display, 
shining to the perfect day.
