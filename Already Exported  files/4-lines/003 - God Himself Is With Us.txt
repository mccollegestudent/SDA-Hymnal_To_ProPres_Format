God Himself is with us; Let us all adore Him,
And with awe appear before Him.

Soul, in silence fear Him,Humbly,

fervently draw near Him.
Now His own who have known God,
 in worship lowly,Yield their spirits wholly.

Come, abide within me; 
Let my soul, like Mary,
Be thine earthly sanctuary,
Come, in-dwelling Spirit, 

Verse 2
With transfigured splendour;
Love and honour will I render.
Where I go here below, 
Let me bow before Thee.

Verse 3
Gladly we surrender 
Earth’s deceitful treasures,
Pride of Life, and sinful pleasures:
Gladly, Lord, we offer Thine to be forever,

Verse 3
Soul and life and each endeavour.
Thou alone shalt be known 
Lord of all our being,
Life’s true way declaring.
