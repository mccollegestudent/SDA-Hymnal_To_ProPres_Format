348 - The Church Has One Foundation

Verse 1
The church's one foundation
is Jesus Christ her Lord;
she is his new creation
by water and the Word.

Verse 1
From heaven he came and sought her
to be his holy bride;
with his own blood he bought her,
and for her life he died. 

Verse 2
Elect from every nation,
yet one o'er all the earth;
her charter of salvation,
one Lord, one faith, one birth;

Verse 2
one holy name she blesses,
partakes one holy food,
and to one hope she presses,
with every grace endued.

Verse 3
Though with a scornful wonder
we see her sore oppressed,
by schisms rent asunder,
by heresies distressed,

Verse 3
yet saints their watch are keeping;
their cry goes up, "How long?"
And soon the night of weeping
shall be the morn of song.

Verse 4
'Mid toil and tribulation,
and tumult of her war,
she waits the consummation
of peace forevermore;

Verse 4
till, with the vision glorious,
her longing eyes are blest,
and the great church victorious
shall be the church at rest.
