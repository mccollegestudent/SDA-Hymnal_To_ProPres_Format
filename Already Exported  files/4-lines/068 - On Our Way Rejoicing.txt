Verse 1
On our way rejoicing
Gladly let us go;
Conquer'd hath our Leader,
Vanquish'd is the foe.

Verse 1
Christ without, our safety;
Christ within, our joy;
Who, if we be faithful,
Can our hope destroy?

Chorus
On our way rejoicing
As we forward move,
Hearken to our praises,
O blest God of love!

Verse 2
Unto God the Father
Joyful songs we sing,
Unto God the Savior
Thankful hearts we bring,

Verse 2
Unto God the Spirit
Bow we and adore,
On our way rejoicing
Now and evermore.

Chorus
On our way rejoicing
As we forward move,
Hearken to our praises,
O blest God of love!
