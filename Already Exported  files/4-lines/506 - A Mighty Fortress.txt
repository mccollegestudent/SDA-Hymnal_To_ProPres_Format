506 - A Mighty Fortress

Verse 1
A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing;
our helper he amid the flood
of mortal ills prevaling.

Verse 1
For still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,

Verse 1
on earth is not his equal.

Verse 2
Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right man on our side,
the man of God's own choosing.

Verse 2
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is he;
Lord Sabbaoth, his name,
from age to age the same,

Verse 2
and he must win the battle.

Verse 3
And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God hath willed
his truth to triumph through us.

Verse 3
The Prince of Darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
for lo, his doom is sure;

Verse 3
one little word shall fell him.

Verse 4
That word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, abideth;
the Spirit and the gifts are ours,
thru him who with us sideth.

Verse 4
Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill;
God's truth abideth still;

Verse 4
his kingdom is forever.
