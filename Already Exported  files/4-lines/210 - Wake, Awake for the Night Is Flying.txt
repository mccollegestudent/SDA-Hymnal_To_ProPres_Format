210 - Wake, Awake for the Night Is Flying

Verse 1
Wake, awake, for night is flying,
The watchmen on the heights are crying,
Awake, Jerusalem, arise!
Midnight's solemn hour is tolling,

Verse 1
His chariot wheels are nearer rolling,
He comes; prepare, ye virgins wise.
Rise up with willing feet
Go forth, the Bridegroom meet; Alleluia!

Verse 1
Bear through the night your well-trimmed light,
Speed forth to join the marriage rite.

Verse 2
Zion hears the watchmen singing, 
Her heart with deep delight is springing,
She wakes, she rises from her gloom;
Forth her Bridegroom comes, all-glorious,

Verse 2
In grace arrayed, by truth victorious;
Her Star is risen, her Light is come!
All hail, incarnate Lord,
Our crown, and our reward! Alleluia!

Verse 2
We haste along, in pomp and song,
And gladsome join the marriage throng.

Verse 3
Lamb of God, the heavens adore Thee,
And men and angels sing before Thee,
With harp and cymbal's clearest tone.
By the pearly gates in wonder

Verse 3
We stand, and swell the voice of thunder,
That echoes round Thy dazzling throne.
No vision ever brought,
No ear hath ever caught,

Verse 3
Such bliss and joy;
We raise the song, we swell the throng,
To praise Thee ages all along.
