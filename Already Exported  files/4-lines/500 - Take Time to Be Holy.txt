spend much time in secret
with Jesus alone.

like him thou shalt be;
thy friends in thy conduct
his likeness shall see.

let him be thy guide,
and run not before him,

still follow the Lord,

be calm in thy soul,
each thought and each motive
beneath his control.

Thus led by his spirit
to fountains of love,
thou soon shalt be fitted
for service above.
