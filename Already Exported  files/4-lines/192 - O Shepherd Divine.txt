Verse 1
O Shepherd divine, I know Thou art mine;
Thy search in the night was for me.
This bleak world is cold, but warm is Thy fold;
My Shepherd, I follow Thee.

Verse 1
Thy beautiful lamp shineth bright o'er my way,
Thy glorious light unto Thy perfect day.
Thro' pastures serene, Thro'valleys of green,
My Shepherd, I follow Thee.

Verse 2
O Shepherd divine, I know Thou art mine;
Thy great heart was broken for me.
Thy grace and Thy law I picture in awe;
They kissed upon Calvary.

Verse 2
Ah! life that was given to ransom my soul,
Ah! heart that was broken to make sinners whole,
This world is but loss In view of Thy cross,
My Shepherd, I follow Thee.

Verse 3
O Shepherd divine, I know Thou art mine;
I hear Thee say, "Follow thou Me."
Thy message today illumines my way;
The Spirit of Prophecy.

Verse 3
I thrill at Thy marvelous love to Thy sheep,
The way Thou dost lead to the still waters deep,
One staff and one rod, One fold and one God,
My Shepherd, I follow Thee.
