646 - To the Name That Brings Salvation

Verse 1
To the name that brings salvation 
Let the nations bow the head; 
Let them kneel in adoration 
When this name of names is said; 

Verse 1
Let them pray for restoration 
Of all things in Christ the head.

Verse 2
He through every generation 
Rules in endless majesty; 
May the kings of every nation 
Now foreswear their enmity, 

Verse 2
And with humble veneration 
In the love of God agree.

Verse 3
Lord, we pray for upright rulers: 
Guard them surely in their need 
From the vanity of power 
And the emptiness of greed; 

Verse 3
Let them see the truth of lowness, 
And on justice let them feed.
