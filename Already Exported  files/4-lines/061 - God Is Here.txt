Verse 1
God is here as we his people
meet to offer praise and prayer,
may we find in fuller measure
what it is in Christ we share.

Verse 1
Here, as in the world around us,
all our varied skills and arts
wait the coming of his Spirit
into open minds and hearts.

Verse 2
Here are symbols to remind us
of our lifelong need of grace;
here are table, font and pulpit;
here the Word has central place.

Verse 2
Here in honesty of preaching,
here in silence, as in speech,
here in newness and renewal,
God the Spirit comes to each.

Verse 3
Here our children find a welcome
in the Shepherd's flock and fold.
Here, as bread and wine are taken,
Christ sustains us, as of old.

Verse 3
Here the servants of the Servant
seek in worship to explore
what it means in daily living
to believe and to adore.

Verse 4
Lord of all, Church and Kingdom,
in an age of change and doubt,
keep us faithful to the Gospel,
help us work your purpose out.

Verse 4
Here, in this day's dedication,
all we have to give, receive:
we, who cannot live without you,
we adore you! We believe!
