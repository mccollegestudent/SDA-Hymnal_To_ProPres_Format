198 - And Can It Be?

Verse 1
And can it be that I should gain 
an interest in the Savior's blood! 
Died he for me? who caused his pain! 
For me? who him to death pursued? 
Amazing love! How can it be 

Verse 1
that thou, my God, shouldst die for me? 

Chorus
Amazing love! How can it be 
that thou, my God, shouldst die for me? 

Verse 2
He left his Father's throne above 
so free, so infinite his grace!; 
emptied himself of all but love, 
and bled for Adam's helpless race. 
'Tis mercy all, immense and free, 

Verse 2
for O my God, it found out me! 

Chorus
Amazing love! How can it be 
that thou, my God, shouldst die for me? 

Verse 3
Long my imprisoned sprit lay, 
fast bound in sin and nature's night; 
thine eye diffused a quickening ray; 
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light; 
my chains fell off, my heart was free, 

Verse 3
I rose, went forth, and followed thee. 

Chorus
Amazing love! How can it be 
that thou, my God, shouldst die for me? 

Verse 4
No condemnation now I dread; 
Jesus, and all in him, is mine; 
alive in him, my living Head, 
and clothed in righteousnes divine, 
bold I approach th' eternal throne, 

Verse 4
and claim the crown, through Christ my own. 

Chorus
Amazing love! How can it be 
that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
