Verse 1
Blest be the King whose coming
Is in the name of God!
For Him let doors be opened,
No hearts against Him barred!
Not robed in royal splendor,

Verse 1
In power and pomp comes He;
But clad as are the poorest,
Such His humility.

Verse 2
Blest be the King whose coming
Is in the name of God!
By those who truly listen
His voice is truly heard;
Pity the proud and haughty,

Verse 2
Who have not learned to heed
The Christ who is the promise,
Who has atonement made.

Verse 3
Blest be the King whose coming
Is in the name of God!
He only to the humble
Reveals the face of God.
All power is His, all glory!

Verse 3
All things are in His hand,
All ages and all peoples,
'Till time itself shall end.

Verse 4
Blest be the King whose coming
Is in the name of God!
He offers to the burdened
The rest and grace they need.
Gentle is He and humble!

Verse 4
And light his Yoke shall be,
For He would have us bear it,
So He can made us free!
