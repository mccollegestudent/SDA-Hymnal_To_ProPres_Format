072 - Creator of the Stars of Night

Verse 1
Creator of the stars of night,
Thy people's ever lasting light,
O Christ, Thou Savior of us all,
We pray Thee, hear us when we call.

Verse 2
At the great name of Jesus, now
All knees must bend, all hearts must bow;
And things celestial Thee shall own,
And things terrestial, Lord alone.

Verse 3
To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in one,
Laud, honor, might, and glory be
From age to age eternally. Amen.
