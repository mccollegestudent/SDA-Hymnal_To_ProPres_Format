234 - Christ Is the World's Light 

Verse 1
Christ is the world's Light,
He and none other; born in our darkness,
He became our brother.
If we have seen Him, we have seen the Father:
Glory to God on high!

Verse 2
Christ is the world's Peace,
He and none other; no one can serve Him
and despise another.
Who else unites us one in God the Father?
Glory to God on high!

Verse 3
Christ is the world'sLife,
He and none other; sold once for silver,
murdered here, our broher,
He who redeems us reigns with God the Father.

Verse 4
Give God the glory,
God and none other; give God the glory,
Spirit, Son, and Father; give God the glory,
God in Man my brother; Glory to God on high!
