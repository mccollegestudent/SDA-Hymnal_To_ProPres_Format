223 - Crown Him With Many Crowns

Verse 1
Crown him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon his throne,
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns
all music but its own.
Awake, my soul, and sing

Verse 1
of him who died for thee,
and hail him as thy matchless King
through all eternity.

Verse 2
Crown him the Lord of love!
behold his hands and side,
those wounds, yet visible above,
in beauty glorified;
No angel in the sky

Verse 2
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bend his wondering eye
At mysteries so great.

Verse 3
Crown him the Lord of peace!
whose power a scepter sways
from pole to pole, that wars may cease,
and all be prayer and praise.
His reign shall know no end,

Verse 3
and round his pierced feet
fair flowers of paradise extend
their fragrance ever sweet.

Verse 4
Crown him the Lord of years;
The potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime!
All hail, Redeemer, hail!

Verse 4
For thou hast died for me;
thy praise shall never, never fail
throughout eternity.
