Verse 1
Here in Christ we gather,
love of Christ our calling.
Christ, our love, is with us,
gladness be His greeting
Let us fear Him, yes, and love Him,

Verse 1
God eternal.
Loving Him, let each love
Christ in all his brethren.

Chorus
God is love, and where true love is
God Himself is there.

Verse 2
When we Christians gather, 
members of one body,
Let there be in us no
discord but one spirit.
Banished now be anger,

Verse 2
strife, and every quarrel.
Christ, our God, be always
present here among us.

Chorus
God is love, and where true love is
God Himself is there.

Verse 3
Grant us love's fulfillment,
joy with all the blessed,
When we see Your face,
O Savior, in its glory.
Shine on us, O purest

Verse 3
Light of all creation,
Be our bliss while endless
ages sing Your praises.

Chorus
God is love, and where true love is
God Himself is there.
