429 - Jerusalem the Golden

Verse 1
Jerusalem the golden,
With milk and honey blest,
Beneath thy contemplation
Sink heart and voice oppressed.
I know not, O I know not

Verse 1
What holy joys are there;
What radiancy of glory,
What bliss beyond compare.

Verse 2
They stand, those hall of Zion,
All jubilant with song,
And bright with many an angel,
And all the martyr throng.
The Prince is ever in them,

Verse 2
The daylight is serene;
The pastures of the blessed
Are deck in glorious sheen.

Verse 3
There is the throne of David,
And there, from care released,
The shout of them that triumph,
The song of them that feast;
And they who, with their Leader,

Verse 3
Have conquered in the fight,
Forever and forever
Are clad in robes of white.

Verse 4
O sweet and blessed country,
The home of God's elect!
O sweet and blessed country,
That eager hearts expect!
Jesus, in mercy bring us

Verse 4
To  that dear land of rest;
Who art, with God the Father,
And Spirit, ever blest.
