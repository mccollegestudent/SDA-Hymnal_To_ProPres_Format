194 - Sing We of the Modern City

Verse 1
Sing we of the modern city,
Scene alike of joy and stress;
Sing we of its namelss people
In their urban wilderness.
Into endless rows of houses

Verse 1
Life is set a millionfold,
Life expressed in human beings
Daily born and growing old.

Verse 2
In the city full of people,
World of speed and hectic days,
In the everchanging setting
Of the latest trend and craze,
Christ is present, and among us;

Verse 2
In the crowd we see Him stand.
In the bustle of the city
Jesus Christ is every man.

Verse 3
God is not remote in heaven,
But on earth to share our shame,
Changing graph and mass and number
Into persons with a name.
Christ has shown, beyond statistics,

Verse 3
Human life with glory crowned,
By His timeless presence proving
People matter, people count!
