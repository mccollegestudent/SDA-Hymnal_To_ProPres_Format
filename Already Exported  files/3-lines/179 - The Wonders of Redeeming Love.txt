179 - The Wonders of Redeeming Love

Verse 1
The wonders of redeeming love
Our highest thoughts exceed;
The Son of God comes from above

Verse 1
For sinful man to bleed.

Verse 2
He gives Himself, His life, His all,
A sinless sacrifice.
For man He drains the cup of gall,

Verse 2
For man the victim dies.

Verse 3
And now before His Father's face
His precious blood He pleads;
For those who seek the throne of grace

Verse 3
His lovee still intercedes.

Verse 4
He knows the frailties of our frame,
For He has borne our grief;
Our great High Priest once felt the same,

Verse 4
And He can send relief.

Verse 5
His love will not be satisfied,
Till He in glory sees
The faithful ones for whom He died

Verse 5
From sin forever free.
