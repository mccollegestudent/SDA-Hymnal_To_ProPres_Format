204 - Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus 

Verse 1
Come, thou long expected Jesus!
born to set thy people free; 
from our fears and sins release us, 

Verse 1
let us find our rest in thee. 
Israel's strength and consolation, 
hope of all the earth thou art; 

Verse 1
dear desire of every nation, 
joy of every longing heart.

Verse 2
Born thy people to deliver, 
born a child and yet a King, 
born to reign in us forever, 

Verse 2
now thy gracious kingdom bring. 
By thine own eternal spirit 
rule in all our hearts alone; 

Verse 2
by thine all sufficient merit, 
raise us to thy glorious throne.
