370 - Christ for the World

Verse 1
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,
with loving zeal;

Verse 1
the poor, and them that mourn,
the faint and overborne,
sinsick and sorrow-worn,

Verse 1
whom Christ doth heal.

Verse 2
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,
with fervent prayer;

Verse 2
the wayward and the lost,
by restless passions tossed,
redeemed at countless cost,

Verse 2
from dark despair.

Verse 3
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,
with joyful song;

Verse 3
the newborn souls, whose days,
reclaimed from error's ways,
inspired with hope and praise,

Verse 3
to Christ belong.
