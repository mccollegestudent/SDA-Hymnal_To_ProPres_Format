465 - I Heard the Voice of Jesus

Verse 1
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"Come unto Me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down

Verse 1
Thy head upon My breast."
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary and worn and sad;

Verse 1
I found in Him a resting place,
And He has made me glad.

Verse 2
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"Behold, I freely give
The living water; thirsty one,

Verse 2
Stoop down and drink and live."
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life giving stream;

Verse 2
My thirst was quench'd, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.

Verse 3
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"I am this dark world's light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,

Verse 3
And all thy day be bright."
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my star, my sun;

Verse 3
And in that light of  life I'll walk,
Till trav'ling  days are done.
