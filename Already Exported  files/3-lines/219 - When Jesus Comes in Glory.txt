As Lord and King of kings,

His face will shine like sunlight,
His head be white as snow,

His eyes like flaming firelight,
His feet like brass aglow.

His voice like rushing waters
Will reach with mighty sound
Into the deepest quarters

Of all creation round;
And at this wondrous greeting
The dead in Christ shall rise,

Their Lord and Savior meeting
In glory in the skies.

And we who are believing
And His appearing love,
Shall know we are receiving

His glory from above;
His resurrection power
Will raise us to the place

Where we that wondrous hour
Shall see Him face to face.

O hasten Thine appearing,
Thou bright and Morning Star!
Lord, may we soon be hearing

The trumpet sound afar;
Thy people all are yearning
To be Thy raptured bride,

And at Thine own returning
Be caught up to Thy side.
