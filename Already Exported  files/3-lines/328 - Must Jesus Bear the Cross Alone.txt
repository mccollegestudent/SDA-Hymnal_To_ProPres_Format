Must Jesus bear the cross alone, 
and all the world go free? 
No, there's a cross for everyone, 

Verse 1
and there's a cross for me. 

Verse 2
The consecrated cross I'll bear 
till He shall set me free; 
and then go home my crown to wear,

for there's a crown for me. 

Verse 3
Upon the crystal pavement, down 
at Jesus' pierced feet,
with joy I'll cast my golden crown,

and His dear name repeat.
