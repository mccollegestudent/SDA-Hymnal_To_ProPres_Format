Verse 1
I'm but a stranger here,
Heav'n is my home;
Earth is a desert drear,

Heav'n is my home.
Danger and sorrow stand
Round me on every hand;

Verse 1
Heav'n is my fatherland,
Heav'n is my home.

Verse 2
What though the tempest rage,
Heav'n is my home;
Short is my pilgrimage,

Verse 2
Heav'n is my home;
And time's wild wintry blast
Soon shall be over past;

Verse 2
I shall reach home at last,
Heav'n is my home.

Verse 3
There at my Savior's side
Heav'n is my home;
I shall be glorified,

Verse 3
Heav'n is my home;
There are the good and blest,
Those I love most and best;

Verse 3
And there I, too, shall rest,
Heav'n is my home.
