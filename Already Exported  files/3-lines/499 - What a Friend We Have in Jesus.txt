Verse 1
What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry

Verse 1
Everything to God in prayer!
Oh, what peace we often forfeit;
Oh, what needless pain we bear

Verse 1
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Verse 2
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged

Verse 2
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?

Verse 2
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Verse 3
Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge

Verse 3
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do your friends despise, forsake you?
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Verse 3
In his arms he'll take and shield you;
You will find a solace there.
