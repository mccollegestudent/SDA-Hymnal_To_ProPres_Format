525 - Hiding in Thee

Verse 1
O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine, would I be;

Verse 1
Thou blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee.

Chorus
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
Thou blest "Rock of Ages,"
I'm hiding in Thee.

Verse 2
In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation casts over me its power;
In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,

Verse 2
Thou blest "Rock of Ages," I'm hiding in Thee.

Chorus
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
Thou blest "Rock of Ages,"
I'm hiding in Thee.

Verse 3
How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my refuge and breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials like sea billows roll,

Verse 3
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.

Chorus
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
Thou blest "Rock of Ages,"
I'm hiding in Thee.
