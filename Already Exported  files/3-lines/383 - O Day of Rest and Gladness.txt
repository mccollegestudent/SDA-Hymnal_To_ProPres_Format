383 - O Day of Rest and Gladness

Verse 1
O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness,

Verse 1
Most beautiful, most bright,
On thee the high and lowly
Before th' eternal throne

Verse 1
Sing, "Holy, holy, holy,"
To the great Three in One.

Verse 2
Thou art a port protected
From storms that round us rise;
A garden intersected

Verse 2
With streams of paradise;
Thou art a cooling fountain
In life's dry dreary sand;

Verse 2
From Thee, like Pisgah's mountain,
We view our promised land.

Verse 3
A day of sweet reflection
Thou art, a day of love,
A day to raise affection

Verse 3
From earth to things above.
New graces ever gaining
From this our day of rest,

Verse 3
We seek the rest remaining
To mansions of the blest.
