All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,

And glory shone around.

Had seized their troubled mind-
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring,

Verse 2
To you and all mankind.

Is born of David's line,
The Savior who is Christ the Lord;

Verse 4
"The heavenly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,

Verse 4
And in a manger laid."

Thus spake the seraph; and forth with
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels praising God on high,

Verse 5
Who thus addressed their song:

"All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace;
Good will henceforth from heaven to men,

Verse 6
Begin and never cease!"
