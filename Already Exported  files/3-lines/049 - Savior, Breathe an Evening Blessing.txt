Savior, breathe an evening blessing,
Ere repose our spirits seal;

Though the night be dark and dreary,
Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
Thou art He who, never weary,

Watchest where Thy people be.

Though destruction walk around us.
Though the arrow past us fly,
Angel guards from Thee Surround us,

We are safe if Thou art nigh.

Should swift death this night o're-take us,
And our couch become our tomb,
May the morn of glory wake us,
