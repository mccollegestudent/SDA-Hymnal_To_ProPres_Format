400 - I Come With Joy

Verse 1
I come with joy to meet my Lord,
Forgiven, loved and free,
In awe and wonder to recall

Verse 1
His life laid down for me,
His life laid down for me.

Verse 2
I come with Christians far and near
To find, as all are fed,
Our true community of love

Verse 2
In Christ's communion bread,
In Christ's communion bread.

Verse 3
As Christ breaks bread for us to share
Each proud division ends.
That love that made us makes us one,

Verse 3
And strangers now are friends,
And strangers now are friends.

Verse 4
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.
His presence always near,
Is in such friendship better known:

Verse 4
We see and praise Him here,
We see and praise Him here.

Verse 5
Together met, together bound,
We'll go our diff'rent ways,
And as His people in the world,

Verse 5
We'll live and speak His praise,
We'll live and speak His praise.
