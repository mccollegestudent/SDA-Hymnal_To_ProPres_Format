Verse 1
Great our joy as now we gather
Where the Master makes us one:
Where we worship God the Father

Thro' the Spirit of His Son.
All who search for His church
Find it where His will is done.

Verse 2
Precious is the tie that binds us
To our God when faith grows cold;
Precious all that now reminds us

He is still our safe stronghold.
Faithful love serves to prove
Here the Shepherd has His fold.

Verse 3
May we learn from Christ's example
How to use this house of prayer:
He who loved and cleansed His temple

Wants us all to worship there.
God the Son shuts out none:
In His Kingdom all may share.

Lord, inspire us with Your vision
Of a world which must be won!
Glorious is the church's mission,

Long endeavored, scarce begun!
Faithful now- this is how
God's eternal will is done.
