376 - All Things Are Thine

Verse 1
All things are Thine; no gift have we,
Lord of all gifts, to offer Thee;
And hence with grateful hearts today,

Verse 1
Thine own before Thy feet we lay.

Verse 2
Thy will was in the builder's thought;
Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;
Thro' mortal motive, scheme and plan,

Verse 2
Thy wise, eternal purpose ran.

Verse 3
No lack Thy perfect fullness knew;
For human needs and longings grew
This house of prayer- this home of rest.

Verse 3
Here may Thy saints be often blessed.

Verse 4
In weakness and in want we call
On Thee, for whom the heav'ns are small;
Thy glory is Thy children's good,

Verse 4
Thy joy Thy tender Fatherhood.

Verse 5
O Father! deign these walls to bless;
Make this the abode of righteousness,
And let these doors a gateway be

Verse 5
To lead us from ourselves to Thee!
