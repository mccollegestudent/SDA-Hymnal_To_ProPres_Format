130 - It Came Upon the Midnight Clear

Verse 1
It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth,

Verse 1
To touch their harps of gold:
"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heavens all gracious King!"

Verse 1
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Verse 2
Still through the cloven skies they come,
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats

Verse 2
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,

Verse 2
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

Verse 3
O ye beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way

Verse 3
With painful steps and slow;
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;

Verse 3
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.
