123 - As With Gladness Men of Old

Verse 1
As with gladness men of old
Did the guiding star behold,
As with joy they hailed its light,

Verse 1
Leading onward, beaming bright,
So, most gracious Lord, may we
Evermore be led to Thee.

Verse 2
As with joyful steps they sped
To that lowly manger bed,
There to bend the knee before

Verse 2
Him whom heav’n and earth adore,
So may we with willing feet
Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

Verse 3
As they offered gifts most rare
At that manger rude and bare,
So may we with holy joy,

Verse 3
Pure, and free from sin’s alloy,
All our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee our heav’nly King.

Verse 4
Holy Jesus, every day
Keep us in the narrow way;
And, when earthly things are past,

Verse 4
Bring our ransomed souls at last
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
