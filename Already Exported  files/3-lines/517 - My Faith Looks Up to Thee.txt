517 - My Faith Looks Up to Thee

Verse 1
My faith looks up to thee,
thou Lamb of Calvary,
Savior divine;

Verse 1
Now hear me while I pray,
take all my guilt away,
O let me from this day

Verse 1
be wholly Thine.

Verse 2
May thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart,
my zeal inspire!

Verse 2
As thou hast died for me,
O may my love to thee
pure, warm, and changeless be,

Verse 2
a living fire!

Verse 3
While life's dark maze I tread,
and griefs around me spread,
be thou my guide;

Verse 3
bid darkness turn to day,
wipe sorrow's tears away,
nor let me ever stray

Verse 3
from Thee aside.
