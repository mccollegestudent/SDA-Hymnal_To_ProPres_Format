104 - My Shepherd Will Supply My Need

Verse 1
My Shepherd will supply my need,
Jehovah is His name.
In pastures fresh He makes me feed

Verse 1
Beside the living stream.
He brings my wand'ring spirit back
When I forsake His ways,

Verse 1
And leads me, for His mercy's sake,
In paths of truth and grace.

Verse 2
When I walk through the shades of death,
Thy presence is my stay;
A word of Thy supporting breath

Verse 2
Drives all my fears away.
Thy hand in sight of all my foes
Doth still my table spread;

Verse 2
My cup with blessings over flows,
Thine oil anoints my head.

Verse 3
The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days;
O may Thy house be mine abode

Verse 3
And all my work be praise.
There would I find a settled rest
While others go and come;

Verse 3
No more a stranger or a guest,
But like a child at home.
