Jesus, your blood and righteousness
My beauty are, my glorious dress;
Mid flaming worlds, in these arrayed,

Verse 1
With joy shall I lift up my head.

Verse 2
Bold shall I stand in that great day,
Cleansed and redeemed, no debt to pay;
For by your cross absolved I am

Verse 2
From sin and guilt, from fear and shame.

Verse 3
Lord, I believe your precious blood,
Which at the mercy seat of God
Pleads for the captives' liberty,

Verse 3
Was also shed in love for me.

Verse 4
When from the dust of death I rise
To claim my mansion in the skies,
This then shall be my only plea:

Verse 4
Christ Jesus lived and died for me.
