209 - That Glorious Day Is Coming

Verse 1
That glorious day is coming,
The hour is hastening on;
Its radiant light is nearing,

Verse 1
Far brighter than the sun;
In yonder clouds of heaven,
The Savior will appear,

Verse 1
And gather all His chosen,
To meet Him in the air.

Verse 2
The saints, then all victorious
Will go to meet their Lord;
An earth both bright and glorious,

Verse 2
Will then be their reward;
And God Himself there reigning,
Will wipe all tears away;

Verse 2
Nor clouds nor night remaining,
But one eternal day.

Verse 3
O Christian, keep from sleeping,
And let your love abound;
Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,

Verse 3
The trumpet soon will sound!
O sinner, hear the warning!
To Jesus quickly!

Verse 3
Then you, in that blest morning,
May meet Him in the sky!
