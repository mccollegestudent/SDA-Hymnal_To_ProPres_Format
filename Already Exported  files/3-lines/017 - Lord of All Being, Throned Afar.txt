Yet to each loving heart how near!

Shed on our path the glow of day;
Star of our hope, Thy softened light

Cheers the long watches of the night.

Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy's sign;

Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,
Before Thy ever-blazing throne

We ask no luster of our own.

Grant us Thy truth to make us free
And kindling hearts that burn for Thee;
Till all Thy living altars claim

One holy light, one heavenly flame!
One holy light, one heavenly flame.
