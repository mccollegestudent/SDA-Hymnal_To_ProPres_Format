Calling the young and old to rest,
Calling the souls of those distressed,

Not in our temples made with hands

Deigns to abide with us in love,

Making our bodies His temple.

We are God's house of living stones,

Thro'all the passing years, O Lord,
Grant that, when church bells are ringing,
Many may come to hear God's Word

Where He this promise is bringing:
I know My own, My own know Me:
You, not the world, My face shall see;

Verse 5
My peace I leave with you. Amen.
