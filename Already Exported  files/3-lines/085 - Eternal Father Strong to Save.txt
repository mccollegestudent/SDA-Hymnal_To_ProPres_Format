Verse 1
Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,
Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep

Verse 1
Its own appointed limits keep;
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

Verse 2
O Saviour, whose almighty word
The winds and waves submissive heard,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep,

Verse 2
And calm amid its rage didst sleep;
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

Verse 3
O Sacred Spirit, who didst brood
Upon the chaos dark and rude,
Who badd'st its angry tumult cease,

Verse 3
And gavest light and life and peace;
O hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

Verse 4
O Trinity of love and power,
Our brethren shield in dangerâ€™s hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,

Verse 4
Protect them wheresoe'er they go;
And ever let there rise to Thee
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.
