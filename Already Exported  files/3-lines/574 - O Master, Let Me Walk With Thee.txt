Verse 1
O Master, let me walk with thee
in lowly paths of service free;
tell me thy secret; help me bear

Verse 1
the strain of toil, the fret of care.

Verse 2
Help me the slow of heart to move
by some clear, winning word of love;
teach me the wayward feet to stay,

Verse 2
and guide them in the homeward way.

Verse 3
Teach me thy patience; still with thee
in closer, dearer company,
in work that keeps faith sweet and strong,

Verse 3
in trust that triumphs over wrong;

Verse 4
In hope that sends a shining ray
far down the future's broadening way,
in peace that only thou canst give,

Verse 4
with thee, O Master, let me live.
