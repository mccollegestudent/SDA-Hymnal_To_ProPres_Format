363 - Lord, Whose Love in Humble Service

Verse 1
Lord, whose love in humble service
Bore the weight of human need,
Who upon the cross, forsaken,

Verse 1
Worked Your mercy's perfect deed:
We, Your servants, bring the worship
Not of voice alone, but heart;

Verse 1
Consecrating to Your purpose
Every gift which You impart.

Verse 2
Still Your children wander homeless;
Still the hungry cry for bread;
Still the captives long for freedom;

Verse 2
Still in grief we mourn our dead.
As you, Lord, in deep compassion
Healed the sick and freed the soul,

Verse 2
By Your Spirit send Your power
To our world to make it whole.

Verse 3
As we worship, grant us vision,
Till your love's revealing light
In its height and depth and greatness

Verse 3
Dawns upon our quickened sight,
Making known the needs and burdens
Your compassion bids us bear,

Verse 3
Stirring us to ardent service,
Your abundant life to share.
