008 - We Gather Together

Verse 1
We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing;
He chastens and hastens His will to make known.
The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing.

Verse 1
Sing praises to His Name; He forgets not His own.

Verse 2
Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining,
Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;
So from the beginning the fight we were winning;

Verse 2
Thou, Lord, were at our side, all glory be Thine!

Verse 3
We all do extol Thee, Thou leader triumphant,
And pray that Thou still our defender wilt be.
Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;

Verse 3
Thy name be ever praised! O Lord, make us free!
