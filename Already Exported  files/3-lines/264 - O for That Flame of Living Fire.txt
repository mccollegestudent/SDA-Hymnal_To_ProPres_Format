264 - O for That Flame of Living Fire

Verse 1
O for that flame of living fire
Which shone so bright in saints of old;
Which bade their souls to heaven aspire,

Verse 1
Calm in distress, in danger bold!

Verse 2
Where is that spirit, Lord, which dwelt
In Abram's breast, and sealed Him Thine?
Which made Paul's heart with sorrow melt,

Verse 2
And glow with energy divine?

Verse 3
That spirit which from age to age
Proclaimed Thy love, and taught Thy ways?
Brightened Isaiah's vivid page,

Verse 3
And breathed in David's hallowed lays?

Verse 4
Is not Thy grace as mighty now
As when Elijah felt its power?
When glory beamed from Moses' brow,

Verse 4
Or Job endured the trying hour?

Verse 5
Remember, Lord, the ancient days;
Renew Thy work, Thy grace restore;
And while to Thee our hearts we raise,

Verse 5
On us Thy Holy Spirit pour.
