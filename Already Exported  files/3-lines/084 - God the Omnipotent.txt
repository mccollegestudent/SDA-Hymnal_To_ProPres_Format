God the Omnipotent! King, who ordainest
Great winds Thy clarions, the lightnings Thy sword;
Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,

Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

Thy precepts holy, and slighted Thy word;
Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;

God the all righteousness One! man hath defied Thee;
Yet to eternity standeth Thy word;
Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;

Prosper the right, O most merciful Lord.

So shall we render Thee thankful devotion,
For Thy deliverance from peril and sword,
Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,
