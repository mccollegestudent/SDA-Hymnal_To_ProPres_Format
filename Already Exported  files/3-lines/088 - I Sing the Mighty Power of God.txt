088 - I Sing the Mighty Power of God

Verse 1
I sing the almighty power of God,
that made the mountains rise,
that spread the flowing seas abroad,

Verse 1
and built the lofty skies.
I sing the wisdom that ordained
the sun to rule the day;

Verse 1
the moon shines full at God's command,
and all the stars obey.

Verse 2
I sing the goodness of the Lord,
who filled the earth with food,
who formed the creatures thru the Word,

Verse 2
and then pronounced them good.
Lord, how thy wonders are displayed,
where'er I turn my eye,

Verse 2
if I survey the ground I tread,
or gaze upon the sky!

Verse 3
There's not a plant or flower below,
but makes thy glories known,
and clouds arise, and tempests blow,

Verse 3
by order from thy thrown;
while all that borrows life from thee
is ever in thy care;

Verse 3
and everywhere that we can be,
thou, God, art present there.
