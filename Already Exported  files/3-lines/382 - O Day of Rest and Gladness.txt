382 - O Day of Rest and Gladness

Verse 1
O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness,

Verse 1
most beautiful, most bright;
on thee, the high and lowly,
who bend before throne,

Verse 1
sing, "Holy, holy, holy,"
to the Eternal One.

Verse 2
Thou art a port protected
from storms that round us rise;
a garden intersected

Verse 2
with streams of paradise;
thou art a cooling fountain
in life's dry, dreary sand;

Verse 2
from thee, like Pisgah's mountain,
we view our promised land.

Verse 3
A day of sweet reflection,
thou art a day of love,
A day to raise affection

Verse 3
from earth to things above.
New graces ever gaining
from this our day of rest,

Verse 3
We reach the rest remaining
in mansions of the blessed.
