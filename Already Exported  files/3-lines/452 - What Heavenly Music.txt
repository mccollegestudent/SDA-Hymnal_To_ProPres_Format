452 - What Heavenly Music

Verse 1
What heavenly music steals over the sea!
Entrancing the senses like sweet melody!
'Tis the voice of the angels borne soft on the air;

Verse 1
For me they are singing; their welcome I hear.

Verse 2
On the banks of old Jordan, here gazing I stand,
And earnestly longing, I stretch forth my hand;
Send a convoy of angels, dear Jesus, I pray!

Verse 2
Let me join that sweet music; come, take me away.

Verse 3
Though dark are the waters and rough is the wave,
If Jesus permit, the wild surges I'll brave;
For that heavenly music hath ravished me so,

Verse 3
I must join in that chorus! I'll go! let me go!
