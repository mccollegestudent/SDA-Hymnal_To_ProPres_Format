395 - As Birds Unto the Genial Homeland

Verse 1
As birds unto the genial homeland fly,
The winter's cold and low'ring skies to flee,
So seeks my soul Thy gracious presence here

Verse 1
And finds, O God, its rest and peace in Thee.

Verse 2
Here at Thy shrine we leave all vexing care,
For get the disappointment, grief and tear,
And on the wings of hopeful song and prayer

Verse 2
We rise, and rising feel Thy Spirit here.

Verse 3
Bless all who spend this night in pain and woe,
The burdened heart, the fainting, and distressed,
Thy comfort send to darkened homes bereaved,

Verse 3
Thy saving help to those by want oppressed.

Verse 4
Come, Sabbath joy, each trusting heart now fill,
And blissful peace within our homes abide,
May thankful praise each grateful heart now thrill,

Verse 4
And to God's loving care their lives confide.
