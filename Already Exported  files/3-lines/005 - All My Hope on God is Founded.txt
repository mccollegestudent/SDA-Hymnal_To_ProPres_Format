005 - All My Hope on God is Founded

Verse 1
All my hope on God is founded;
He doth still my trust renew,
Me through change and chance He guideth,

Verse 1
Only good and only true.
God unknown, He alone 
Calls my heart to be His own.

Verse 2
Pride of man and earthly glory,
Sword and crown betray his trust;
What with care and toil he buildeth,

Verse 2
Tower and temple fall to dust.
But God's power, hour to hour, 
Is my temple and my tower.

Verse 3
God's great goodness aye endureth,
Deep His wisdom, passing thought:
Splendour, light, and life attend Him,

Verse 3
Beauty springeth out of naught.
Love doth stand at His hand; 
Joy doth wait on His command.

Verse 4
Still from man to God eternal
Sacrifice of praise be done,
High above all praises praising

Verse 4
For the gift of Christ His Son.
Christ doth call one and all;  
Ye who follow shall not fall.
