022 - God Is Our Song

Verse 1
God is our Song, and every singer blest
Who praising Him finds energy and rest.
All who praise God with unaffected joy

Verse 1
Give back to us the widom we destroy,
Give back to us the widom we destroy.

Verse 2
God is our Song, for Jesus comes to save;
While praising Him we offer all we have.
New songs we sing, in ventures new unite,

Verse 2
When Jesus leads us upward into light,
When Jesus leads us upward into light.

Verse 3
This is our Song no conflict ever drowns;
Who praises God our human wrath disowns.
Love knows what rich complexities of sound

Verse 3
God builds upon a simple common ground,
God builds upon a simple common ground.

Verse 4
God is our Silence when no songs are sung,
When ecstasy or sorrow stills the tongue.
Glorious the faith which silently obeys

Verse 4
Until we find again the voice of praise,
Until we find again the voice of praise.
