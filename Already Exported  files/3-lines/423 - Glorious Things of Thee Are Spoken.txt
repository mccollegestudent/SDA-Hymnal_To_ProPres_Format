423 - Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken

Verse 1
Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
He whose word cannot be broken

Verse 1
Formed thee for His own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?

Verse 1
With salvation's wall surrounded,
Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.

Verse 2
See the streams of living waters
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,

Verse 2
And all fear and want remove;
Who can faint when such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage?

Verse 2
Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,
Never fails from age to age.

Verse 3
Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear
For a glory and a covering,

Verse 3
Showing that the Lord is near;
Blest inhabitants of Zion,
Washed in the Redeemer's blood;

Verse 3
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
Makes them kings and priests to God.

Verse 4
Savior, if of Zion's city
I, through grace, a member am,
Let the world deride or pity,

Verse 4
I will glory in Thy name;
Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
All his boasted pomp and show;

Verse 4
Solid joys and lasting treasure
None but Zion's children know.
