636 - God, Whose Giving Knows No Ending

Verse 1
God, whose giving knows no ending,
From Your rich and endless store:
Nature's wonder, Jesus' wisdom,

Verse 1
Costly cross, grave's shattered door.
Gifted by You, we turn to You,
Off'ring up ourselves in praise:

Verse 1
Thankful song shall rise forever,
Gracious donor of our days.

Verse 2
Skills and time are ours for pressing
Toward the goals of Christ, Your Son:
All at peace in health and freedom,

Verse 2
Races joined, the church made one.
Now direct our daily labor,
Lest we strive for self alone:

Verse 2
Born with talents, make us servants
Fit to answer at Your throne.

Verse 3
Treasure, too, You have entrusted,
Gain through pow'rs Your grace conferred:
Ours to use for home and kindred,

Verse 3
And to spread the Gospel Word.
Open wide our hands in sharing,
As we heed Christ's ageless call.

Verse 3
Healing, teaching, and reclaiming,
Serving You by loving all.
