Verse 1
O Jesus Christ, to You may hymns be rising
In every city for Your love and care;
Inspire our worship, grant the glad surprising

Verse 1
That Your blest Spirit brings men everywhere.

Verse 2
Grant us new courage, Vsacrificial, humble,
Strong in Your strength to venture and to dare,
To lift the fallen, guide the feet that stumbe,

Verse 2
Seek out the lonely and God's mercy share.

Verse 3
Show us Your Spirit, brooding o'er each city,
As You did weep above Jerusalem,
Seeking to gather all in love and pity,

Verse 3
And healing those who touch Your garment's hem.
