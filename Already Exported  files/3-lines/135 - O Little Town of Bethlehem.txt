135 - O Little Town of Bethlehem

Verse 1
O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting Light;

Verse 1
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

Verse 2
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth,

Verse 2
And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth!

Verse 3
How silently, how silently, the wondrous Gift is giv'n;
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin,

Verse 3
Where meek souls will receive Him still, the dear Christ enters in.

Verse 4
O holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in, be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell;

Verse 4
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel!
