Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ, our head and cornerstone,
Chosen of the Lord and precious,

Binding all the Church in one;
Holy Zion's help forever
And our confidence alone.

To this temple where we call You,
Come, O Lord of hosts, and stay;
Come, with all Your loving kindness,

Hear Your people as they pray;
And Your fullest benediction
Shed within these walls today.

Grant, we pray to all Your faithful
All the gifts they ask to gain;
What they gain from You forever

With the blessed to retain;
And hereafter in Your glory
Evermore with You to reign.

Praise and honor to the Father,
Praise and honor to the Son,
Praise and honor to the Spirit,

Ever three and ever one:
One in might and one in glory
While unending ages run!
