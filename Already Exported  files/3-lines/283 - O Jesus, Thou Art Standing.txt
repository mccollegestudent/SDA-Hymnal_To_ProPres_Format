283 - O Jesus, Thou Art Standing

Verse 1
O Jesus, thou art standing,
outside the fast closed door,
in lowly patience waiting

Verse 1
to pass the threshold o'er:
O shame, professing Christians,
his Name and sign who bear,

Verse 1
O shame, thrice shame upon us,
to keep him standing there!

Verse 2
O Jesus, thou art knocking;
and lo, that hand is scarred,
and thorns thy brow encircle,

Verse 2
and tears thy face have marred:
O love that passeth knowledge,
so patiently to wait!

Verse 2
O sin that hath no equal,
so fast to bar the gate!

Verse 3
O Jesus, thou art pleading
in accents meek and low,
"I died for you, my children,

Verse 3
and will you treat me so?"
O Lord, with shame and sorrow
we open now the door;

Verse 3
dear Savior, enter, enter,
and leave us never more.
