Verse 1
God is my strong salvation,
What foe have I to fear?
In darkness and temptation,

My Light, my Help, is near:
Though hosts encamp around me,
Firm in the fight I stand;

Verse 1
What terror can confound me,
With God at my right hand?

Verse 2
Place on the reliance;
My soul with courage wait;
His truth be thine affiance,

Verse 2
When faint and desolate.
His might thy heart shall strengthen,
His love thy joy increase;

Mercy thy days shall lengthen;
The Lord will give thee peace.
