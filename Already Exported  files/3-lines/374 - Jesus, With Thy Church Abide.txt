Verse 1
Jesus, with Thy church abide;
Be her Savior, Lord, and Guide,
While on earth her faith is tried:

Verse 1
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Verse 2
May her voice be ever clear,
Warning of a judgment near,
Telling of a Savior dear:

Verse 2
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Verse 3
May she guide the poor and blind,
Seek the lost until she find,
And the broken hearted bind:

Verse 3
We beseech Thee, hear us.

Verse 4
May she holy triumps win,
Overthrow the hosts of sin,
Gather all the nations in:

Verse 4
We beseech Thee, hear us.
