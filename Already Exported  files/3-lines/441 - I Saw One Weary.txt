441 - I Saw One Weary

Verse 1
I saw one weary, sad, and torn,
With eager steps press on the way,
Who long the hallowed cross had born,

Verse 1
Still looking for the promised day;
While many a line of grief and care,
Upon his brow was furrowed there;

Verse 1
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,
"O this"  said he-"the blessed hope."

Verse 2
And one I saw, with sword and shield,
Who boldly braved the world's cold frown,
And fought, unyielding, on the field,

Verse 2
To win an everlasting crown.
Though worn with toil, oppressed by foes,
No murmur from his heart arose;

Verse 2
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,
"O this!" said he-"the blessed hope."

Verse 3
And there was  one who left behind
The cherished friends of early years,
And honor, pleasure, wealth re-signed,

Verse 3
To tread the path bedewed with tears.
Through trials deep and conflict sore,
Yet still a smile of joy he wore;

Verse 3
O! what can bouy the spirit up?
'Tis this alone-the blessed hope.

Verse 4
While pilgrims here we journey on
In this dark vale of sin and gloom,
Through tribulation, hate, and scorn,

Verse 4
Or through the portals of the tomb,
Till our returning King shall come
To tkae His exile captives home,

Verse 4
O! what can bouy the spirits up?
'Tis this alone-- the blessed hope.
