619 - Lead On, O King Eternal

Verse 1
Lead on, O King eternal,
the day of march has come;
henceforth in fields of conquest

Verse 1
thy tents shall be our home.
Through days of preparation
thy grace has made us strong;

Verse 1
and now, O King eternal,
we lift our battle song.

Verse 2
Lead on, O King eternal,
till sin's fierce war shall cease,
and holiness shall whisper

Verse 2
the sweet amen of peace.
For not with swords loud clashing,
nor roll of stirring drums;

Verse 2
with deeds of love and mercy
the heavenly kingdom comes.

Verse 3
Lead on, O King eternal,
we follow, not with fears,
for gladness breaks like morning

Verse 3
where'er thy face appears.
Thy cross is lifted o'er us,
we journey in its light;

Verse 3
the crown awaits the conquest;
lead on, O God of might.
