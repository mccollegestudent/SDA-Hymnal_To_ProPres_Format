Jesus, the very thought of thee 
with sweetness fills the breast;

No voice can sing, no heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,

O hope of every contrite heart!
O joy of all the meek, 
to those who fall, how kind thou art!

But what to those who find? Ah, this 
nor tongue nor pen can show; 
the love of Jesus, what it is,

none but his loved ones know.

Verse 5
Jesus, our only joy be thou, 
as thou our prize wilt be; 
Jesus, be thou our glory now,
