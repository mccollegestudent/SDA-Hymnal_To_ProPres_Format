107 - God Moves in a Mysterious Way

Verse 1
God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea,

Verse 1
And rides upon the storm.

Verse 2
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break

Verse 2
In blessings on your head.

Verse 3
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace;
Behind a frowning providence

Verse 3
He hides a smiling face.

Verse 4
His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste,

Verse 4
But sweet will be the flower.

Verse 5
Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan His work in vain;
God is His own interpreter,

Verse 5
And He will make it plain.
