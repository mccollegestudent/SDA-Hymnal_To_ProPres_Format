Verse 1
Take time to be holy,
speak oft with thy Lord;
abide in him always,

and feed on his word.
Make friends of God's children,
help those who are weak,

forgetting in nothing
his blessing to seek.

Verse 2
Take time to be holy,
the world rushes on;
spend much time in secret

with Jesus alone.
By looking to Jesus,
like him thou shalt be;

thy friends in thy conduct
his likeness shall see.

Verse 3
Take time to be holy,
let him be thy guide,
and run not before him,

whatever betide.
In joy or in sorrow,
still follow the Lord,

Verse 3
and, looking to Jesus,
still trust in his word.

Verse 4
Take time to be holy,
be calm in thy soul,
each thought and each motive

Verse 4
beneath his control.
Thus led by his spirit
to fountains of love,

Verse 4
thou soon shalt be fitted
for service above.
