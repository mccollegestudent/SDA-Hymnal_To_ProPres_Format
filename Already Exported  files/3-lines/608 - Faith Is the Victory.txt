608 - Faith Is the Victory

Verse 1
Encamped along the hills of light,
Ye Christian soldiers, rise,
And press the battle ere the night

Verse 1
Shall veil the glowing skies.
Against the foe in vales below,
Let all our strength be hurled;

Verse 1
Faith is the victory, we know,
That overcomes the world.

Chorus
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!
Oh, glorious victory

Chorus
That overcomes the world.

Verse 2
His banner over us in love,
Our sword the Word of God;
We tread the road the saints above

Verse 2
With shouts of triumph trod.
By faith they, like whirlwind's breath,
Swept on o'er ev'ry field;

Verse 2
The faith by which they conquered death
Is still our shining shield.

Chorus
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!
Oh, glorious victory

Chorus
That overcomes the world.

Verse 3
To him who overcomes the foe
White raiment shall be giv'n;
Before the angels he shall know

Verse 3
His name confessed in heav'n.
Then onward from the hills of light,
Our hearts with love aflame;

Verse 3
We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,
In Jesus' conq'ring name.

Chorus
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!
Oh, glorious victory

Chorus
That overcomes the world.
