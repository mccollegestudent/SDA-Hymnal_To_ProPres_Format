Verse 1
Happy the home when God is there, 
and love fills every breast; 
when one their wish, and one their prayer, 

Verse 1
and one their heavenly rest. 

Verse 2
Happy the home where Jesus' name 
is sweet to every ear; 
where children early speak his fame, 

Verse 2
and parents hold him dear. 

Verse 3
Happy the home where prayer is heard, 
and praise is wont to rise; 
where parents love the sacred Word 

Verse 3
and all its wisdom prize. 

Verse 4
Lord, let us in our homes agree 
this blessed peace to gain; 
unite our hearts in love to thee, 

Verse 4
and love to all will reign.
