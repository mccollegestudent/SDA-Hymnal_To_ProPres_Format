Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With all Thy quickening powers;
Kindle a flame of sacred love

In these cold hearts of ours.

O raise our thoughts from things below,
From vanities and toys!
Then shall we with fresh courage go

To reach eternal joys.

Awake our souls to joyful songs;
Let pure devotions rise;
Till praise employs our thankful tongues,

Verse 3
And doubt forever dies.

Verse 4
Father, we would no longer live
At this poor, dying rate;
To Thee our thankful love we give,

Verse 4
For Thine to us is great.

Verse 5
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With all Thy quickening powers;
Come, shed abroad a Savior's love,

Verse 5
And that shall kindle ours.
