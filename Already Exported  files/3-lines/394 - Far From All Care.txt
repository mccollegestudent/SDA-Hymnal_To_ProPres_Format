394 - Far From All Care

Verse 1
Far from all care we hail the Sabbath morning;
O'er waving fields and from the distant sea
Swell notes of praise in harmony resounding

Verse 1
As all creation turns her heart to Thee.

Verse 2
Though man alone, Lord, of Thy great creation
Fails now to laud Thee for Thy love and power,
Yet still a remnant love Thee and remember

Verse 2
Thy holy law and each sweet Sabbath hour.

Verse 3
Lord of the Sabbath, Savior and Creator,
Calm now the throbbings of each troubled breast.
Speak to our hearts the peace of Thy commandments,

Verse 3
Breathe on each soul fair Eden's hallowed ret.

Verse 4
Strong in Thy might and quiet in Thy meekness,
May we Thine image bear from day to day.
Then may we enter pearly gates eternal

Verse 4
And sing redemption's song each Sabbath day.
