372 - How Beauteous Are Their Feet

Verse 1
How beauteous are their feet
Who stand on Zion's hill;
Who bring salvation on their tongues,

Verse 1
And words of peace reveal!

Verse 2
How charming is their voice,
So sweet the tidings are:
"Zion, behold thy Savior King;

Verse 2
He reigns and triumphs here!"

Verse 3
How happy are our ears,
That hear the joyful sound
Which kings and prophets waited for,

Verse 3
And sought, but never found!

Verse 4
How blessed are our eyes,
That see this heavenly light;
Prophets and kings desired it long,

Verse 4
But died without the sight!

Verse 5
The watchmen join their voice,
And tuneful notes employ;
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,

Verse 5
And deserts learn the joy.
