040 - The Dawn of God's Dear Sabbath

Verse 1
The dawn of God's dear Sabbath
Breaks o'er the earth again,
As some sweet summer morning

Verse 1
After a night of pain;
It comes as cooling showers
To some exhausted land,

Verse 1
As shade of clustered palm trees
'Mid weary wastes of sand.

Verse 2
Lord, we would bring for offering,
Though marred with earthly soil,
A week of earnest labor,

Verse 2
Of steady, faithful toil,
Fair fruits of self denial,
Of strong, deep love to Thee,

Verse 2
Fostered by Thine own Spirit,
In true humility.

Verse 3
And we would bring our burden
Of sinful thought and deed,
In Thy pure presence kneeling,

Verse 3
From bondage to be freed,
Our heart's most bitter sorrow
For all Thy work undone-

Verse 3
So many talents wasted!
So few bright laurels won!

Verse 4
And with that sorrow mingling,
A steadfast faith, and sure,
And love so deep and fervent,

Verse 4
For Thee to make it pure,
In Thy dear presence finding
The pardon that we need,

Verse 4
And then the peace so lasting-
Celestial peace indeed.
