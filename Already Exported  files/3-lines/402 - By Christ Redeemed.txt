402 - By Christ Redeemed

Verse 1
By Christ redeemed, In Christ restored,
We keep the memory adored,
And show the death of our dear Lord,

Verse 1
Until He come.

Verse 2
His broken body in our stead Is here,
In this memorial bread;
And so our feeble love is fed,

Verse 2
Until He come.

Verse 3
His fearful drops of agony,
His life blood shed for us we see;
The wine shall tell the mystery,

Verse 3
Until He come.

Verse 4
And thus that dark betrayal night,
With the last advent unite----
The shame, the glory, by this rite,

Verse 4
Until He come.
