217 - The Church Has Waited Long

Verse 1
The church has waited long
Her absent Lord to see;
And still in loneliness she waits,

Verse 1
A friendless stranger she.

Verse 2
How long, O Lord our God,
Holy and true and good,
Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering church,

Verse 2
Her sighs and tears and blood?

Verse 3
We long to hear Thy voice,
To see Thee face to face,
To share Thy crown and glory then,

Verse 3
As now we share Thy grace.

Verse 4
Come, Lord, and wipe away
The curse, the sin, the stain,
And make this blighted world of ours

Verse 4
Thine own fair world again.
