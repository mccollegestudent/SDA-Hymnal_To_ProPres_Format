299 - Forgive Our Sins as We Forgive

Verse 1
"Forgive our sins as we forgive,"
You taught us, Lord, to pray;
But You alone can grant us grace

Verse 1
To live the words we say.

Verse 2
How can Your pardon reach and bless
The unforgiving heart
That broods on wrongs and will not let

Verse 2
Old bitterness depart?

Verse 3
In blazing light Your cross reveals
The truth we dimly knew:
How trifling others' debts to us;

Verse 3
How great our debt to You!

Verse 4
Lord, cleanse the depths within our souls
And bid resentment cease;
Then, by Your mercy reconciled,

Verse 4
Our lives will spread Your peace.
