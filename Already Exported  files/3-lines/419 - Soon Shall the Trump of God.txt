419 - Soon Shall the Trump of God

Verse 1
Soon shall the trump of God
Give out the welcome sound,
That shakes death's silent chamber walls,

Verse 1
And breaks the turf sealed ground.

Verse 2
You dwellers in the dust,
Awake, come forth, and sing;
Sharp has your frost of winter been,

Verse 2
But bright shall be your spring.

Verse 3
'Twas sown in weakness here;
'Twill then be raised in power;
That which was sown in earthly seed  

Verse 3
Shall rise a heav'nly flower.
