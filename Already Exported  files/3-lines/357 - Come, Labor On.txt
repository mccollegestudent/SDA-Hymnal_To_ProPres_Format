357 - Come, Labor On

Verse 1
Come, labor on.
Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain
While all around him waves the golden grain?

Verse 1
And to each servant does the Master say,
"Go work today."

Verse 2
Come, labor on.
Claim the high calling angels cannot share;
To young and old the gospel gladness bear;

Verse 2
Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.
The night draws nigh.

Verse 3
Come, labor on.
No time for rest; till glows the western sky,
Till the long shadows o√©r our pathway lie,

Verse 3
And a glad sound comes with the setting sun,
"Well done, well done!"
