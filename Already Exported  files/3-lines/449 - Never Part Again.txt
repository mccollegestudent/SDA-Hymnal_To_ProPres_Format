449 - Never Part Again

Verse 1
There is a land of pure delight,
Where bliss eternal reigns,
Infinite day excludes the night 

Verse 1
And pleasures banish pain.

Chorus
We're trav'ling to  Immanuel's land,
We soon shall hear the trumpet sound,
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,

Chorus
And never, never part again.
What! Never part again? No, never part again,
What! Never part again? No, never part again,

Chorus
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,
And never, never part again.

Verse 2
There everlasting spring abides,
And never with'ring flowers,
And but a little space divides

Verse 2
This heav'nly land from ours.

Chorus
We're trav'ling to  Immanuel's land,
We soon shall hear the trumpet sound,
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,

Chorus
And never, never part again.
What! Never part again? No, never part again,
What! Never part again? No, never part again,

Chorus
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,
And never, never part again.

Verse 3
Could we but stand where Moses stood,
And view the landscape o'er,
Not all  this world's pretended good

Verse 3
Could ever charm us more.

Chorus
We're trav'ling to  Immanuel's land,
We soon shall hear the trumpet sound,
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,

Chorus
And never, never part again.
What! Never part again? No, never part again,
What! Never part again? No, never part again,

Chorus
And soon we shall with Jesus reign,
And never, never part again.
