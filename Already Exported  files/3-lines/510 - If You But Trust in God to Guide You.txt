510 - If You But Trust in God to Guide You

Verse 1
If you but trust in God to guide you
And place your confidence in Him,
You'll find Him always there beside you,

Verse 1
To give you hope and strength within.
For those who trust God's changeless love
Build on the rock that will not move.

Verse 2
What gain is there in futile weeping,
In helpless anger and distress?
If you are in His care and keeping,

Verse 2
In sorrow will He love you less?
For He who took for you a cross
Will bring you safe through every loss.

Verse 3
In patient trust await His leisure
In cheerful hope, with heart content
To take whate'er your Father's pleasure

Verse 3
And all discerning love have sent;
Doubt not your inmost wants are known
To Him who chose you for His own.

Verse 4
Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,
Offer your service faithfully,
And trust His word; though undeserving,

Verse 4
You'll find His promise true to be.
God never will forsake in need
The soul that trusts in Him indeed.
