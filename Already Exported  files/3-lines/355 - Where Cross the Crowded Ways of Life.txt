355 - Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life

Verse 1
Where cross the crowded ways of life,
where sound the cries of race and clan,
above the noise of selfish strife,

Verse 1
we hear your voice, O Son of Man.

Verse 2
From tender childhood's helplessness,
from woman's grief, man's burdened toil,
from famished souls, from sorrow's stress,

Verse 2
your heart has never known recoil.

Verse 3
The cup of water given for you still
holds the freshness of your grace;
yet long these multitudes to view

Verse 3
the sweet compassion of your face.

Verse 4
O Master, from the mountainside
make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
among these restless throngs abide;

Verse 4
O tread the city's streets again.

Verse 5
Till all the world shall learn your love
and follow where your feet have trod,
till, glorious from your heaven above,

Verse 5
shall come the city of our God.
