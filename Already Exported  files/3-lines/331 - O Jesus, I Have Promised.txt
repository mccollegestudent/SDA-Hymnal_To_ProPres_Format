331 - O Jesus, I Have Promised

Verse 1
O Jesus, I have promised 
to serve thee to the end; 
be thou forever near me, 

Verse 1
my Master and my friend. 
I shall not fear the battle 
if thou art by my side, 

Verse 1
nor wander from the pathway 
if thou wilt be my guide. 

Verse 2
O let me feel thee near me! 
The world is ever near; 
I see the sights that dazzle, 

Verse 2
the tempting sounds I hear; 
my foes are ever near me, 
around me and within; 

Verse 2
but Jesus, draw thou nearer, 
and shield my soul from sin. 

Verse 3
O Jesus, thou hast promised 
to all who follow thee 
that where thou art in glory 

Verse 3
there shall thy servant be. 
And Jesus, I have promised 
to serve thee to the end; 

Verse 3
O give me grace to follow, 
my Master and my Friend.
