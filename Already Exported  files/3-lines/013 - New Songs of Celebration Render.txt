Verse 1
New songs of celebration render
To Him who has great wonders done.
Love sits enthroned in ageless splendor:

Verse 1
Come, and adore the mighty One.
He has made known His great salvation
Which all His friends with joy confess:

Verse 1
He has revealed to every nation
His everlasting righteousness.

Verse 2
Joyfully, heartily resounding,
Let every instrument and voice
Peal out the praise of grace abounding

Verse 2
Calling the whole world to rejoice.
Trumpets and organs, set in motion
Such sounds as make the heavens ring;

Verse 2
All things that live in earth and ocean,
Make music for your mighty King.

Verse 3
Rivers and seas and torrents roaring,
Honor the Lord with wild acclaim;
Mountains and stones look up adoring,

And find a voice to praise His name.
Righteous, commanding, ever glorious,
Praises be His that never cease:

Verse 3
Just is our God, whose truth victorious,
Establishes the world in peace.
