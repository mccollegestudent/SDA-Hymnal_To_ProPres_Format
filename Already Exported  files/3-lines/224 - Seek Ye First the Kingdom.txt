224 - Seek Ye First the Kingdom

Verse 1
Seek ye first the kingdom, 'Tis your Father's will.
So the voice of Jesus bids us follow still.
Savior, we would hear Thee, Follow, find, and see;

Verse 1
And in life's adventure Thy disciples be.

Verse 2
As for hidden treasure, Or for matchless pearl,
When at last discovered, some will sell their all:
So, when breaks the vision of that kingdom fair,

Verse 2
Ours shall be its riches and its beauty rare.

Verse 3
As the silent leaven works its secret way,
Or as grows the seed grain through the night and day;
Lord, so be the increase, peaceable but sure,

Verse 3
Of Thy word within us, And Thy kingdom's power.

Verse 4
As the tender seedling grows up tall and strong,
And the birds of heaven to its branches throng;
So shall all God's children, from the east and west,

Verse 4
Gather to His kingdom, In its shadow rest.

Verse 5
Humblest shall be greatest, poor in spirit reign;
Home shall come the childlike, born through Thee again
Eager hearts arrive there on the pilgrim's road,

Verse 5
Hail! the kingdom glorious of the living God!
