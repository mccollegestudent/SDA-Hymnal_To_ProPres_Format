163 - At the Cross

Verse 1
Alas! and did my Savior bleed,
and did my Sovereign die?
Would he devote that sacred head

Verse 1
for sinners such as I?

Chorus
At the cross, at the cross,
where I first saw the light,
and the burden of my heart rolled away;

Chorus
it was there by faith I received my sight,
and now I am happy all the day!

Verse 2
Was it for crimes that I have done,
he groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!

Verse 2
And love beyond degree!

Chorus
At the cross, at the cross,
where I first saw the light,
and the burden of my heart rolled away;

Chorus
it was there by faith I received my sight,
and now I am happy all the day!

Verse 3
But drops of grief can ne'er repay
the debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away;

Verse 3
'tis all that I can do!

Chorus
At the cross, at the cross,
where I first saw the light,
and the burden of my heart rolled away;

Chorus
it was there by faith I received my sight,
and now I am happy all the day!
