418 - Day of Judgment, Day of Wonders!

Verse 1
Day of judgement, day of wonders!
Hark the trumpet's awful sound,
Louder than a thousand thunders,

Verse 1
Shakes the vast creation round!
How the summons
Will the sinner's heart confound!

Verse 2
See the Lord in the glory nearing,
Clothed in majesty divine,
You who long for His appearing,

Verse 2
Then shall say, "This God is mine!"
Gracious Savior, Gracious Savior,
Own me in that day as Thine.

Verse 3
At His call the dead awaken,
Rise to life form earth and sea!
All the powers of nature shaken

Verse 3
By His looks prepare to flee.
Careless sinner, Careless sinner,
What will then become of thee?

Verse 4
But to those who have confessed
Loved and served the Lord below,
He will say, "Come near, ye blessed,

Verse 4
See the kingdom I bestow;
You forever, You forever
Shall my love and glory know."
