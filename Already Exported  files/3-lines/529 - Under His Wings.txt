Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;

Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings, my soul shall abide,

How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,

Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings, my soul shall abide,

There will I hide till life's trials are over;
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;

Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.

Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings, my soul shall abide,
