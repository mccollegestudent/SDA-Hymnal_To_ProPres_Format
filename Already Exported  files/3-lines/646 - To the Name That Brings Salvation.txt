Verse 1
To the name that brings salvation 
Let the nations bow the head; 
Let them kneel in adoration

When this name of names is said; 
Let them pray for restoration 
Of all things in Christ the head.

He through every generation 
Rules in endless majesty; 
May the kings of every nation 

Verse 2
Now foreswear their enmity, 
And with humble veneration 
In the love of God agree.

Verse 3
Lord, we pray for upright rulers: 
Guard them surely in their need 
From the vanity of power

And the emptiness of greed; 
Let them see the truth of lowness, 
And on justice let them feed.
