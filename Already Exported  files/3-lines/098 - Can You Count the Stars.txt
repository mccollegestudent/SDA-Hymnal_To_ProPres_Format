Verse 1
Can you count the stars that brightly
Twinkle in the midnight sky?
Can you count the clouds, so lightly

Verse 1
O'er the meadows floating by?
God, the Lord, doth mark their number
With His eyes that never slumber;

Verse 1
He hath made every one,
He hath made them every one.

Verse 2
Can you count the wings now flashing
In the sunshine's golden light?
Can you count the fishes splashing

Verse 2
In the cooling waters bright?
God, the Lord, a name hath given,
To all creatures under heaven;

Verse 2
He hath named them every one,
He hath named them every one.

Verse 3
Do you know how many children
Rise each morning blithe and gay?
Can you count their jolly voices,

Verse 3
Singing sweetly day by day?
God hears all the happy voices,
In their merry songs rejoices;

Verse 3
And He loves them, every one,
And He loves them, every one.
