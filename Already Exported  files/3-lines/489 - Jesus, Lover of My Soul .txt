489 - Jesus, Lover of My Soul 

Verse 1
Jesus, lover of my soul,
Let me to thy bosom fly,
While the billows near me roll,

Verse 1
While the tempest still is high;
Hide me, O my Savior, hide!
Till the storm of life is past;

Verse 1
Safe into the haven guide,
O receive my soul at last!

Verse 2
Other refuge has I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on thee;
Leave O leave me not alone!

Verse 2
Still support and comfort me;
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;

Verse 2
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Verse 3
Thou, O Christ, all I want,
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,

Verse 3
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;

Verse 3
Vile and full of sin I am;
Thou art full of truth and grace.

Verse 4
Plenteous grace with Thee is found-
Grace to pardon all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound,

Verse 4
Make and keep me pure within;
Thou of life the Fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee;

Verse 4
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity.
