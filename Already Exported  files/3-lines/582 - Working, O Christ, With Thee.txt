582 - Working, O Christ, With Thee

Verse 1
Working, O Christ, with Thee, working with Thee,
Unworthy, sinful, weak, though we may be;
Our all to Thee we give, for Thee alone we live,

Verse 1
And by Thy grace achieve, working with Thee.

Verse 2
Along the city's waste, working with Thee,
Our eager footsteps haste, like Thee to be;
The poor we gather in, the outcasts raise from sin,

Verse 2
And labor souls to win, working with Thee.

Verse 3
Savior, we weary not, working with Thee,
As hard as Thine our lot can never be;
Our joy and comfort this, "Thy grace sufficent is;"

Verse 3
This changes toil to bliss, working with Thee.

Verse 4
So let us labor on, working with Thee,
Till earth to Thee is won, from sin set free;
Till men, from shore to shore, receive Thee, and adore,

Verse 4
And join us evermore, working with Thee.
