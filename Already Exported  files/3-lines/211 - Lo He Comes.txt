211 - Lo! He Comes

Verse 1
Lo! He comes, with clouds descending,
Once for favored sinners slain;
Countless angels, Him attending,

Verse 1
Swell the triumph of His train:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Jesus comes, and comes to reign.

Verse 2
Every eye shall now behold Him
Robed in dreadful majesty!
Those who set at nought and sold Him,

Verse 2
Pierced, and nailed Him to the tree,
Deeply wailing, Deeply wailing,
Shall the true Mesiah see!

Verse 3
When the solemn trump has sounded,
Heaven and earth shall flee away;
All who hate Him, must, confounded,

Verse 3
Hear the summons of that day-
"Come to judgment! Come to judgment!
Come to judgment! Come away!"

Verse 4
Yea, amen! let all adore Thee,
High on Thy eternal throne!
Savior, take the power and glory,

Verse 4
Make Thy righteous sentence known;
O come quickly, O come quickly,
Claim the kingdom for Thine own!
