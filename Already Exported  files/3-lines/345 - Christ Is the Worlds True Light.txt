345 - Christ Is the World's True Light

Verse 1
Christ is the world's true light,
Its captain of salvation,
The daystar clear and bright

Verse 1
Of every man and nation;
New life, new hope awakes
Where'er men own His sway:

Verse 1
Freedom her bondage breaks,
And night is turned to day.

Verse 2
In Christ all races meet,
Their ancient feuds forgeting,
The whole round world complete,

Verse 2
From sunrise to its setting:
When Christ is throned as Lord,
Men shall forsake their fear,

Verse 2
To plowshare beat the sword,
To pruning hook the spear.

Verse 3
One Lord, in one great name
Unite us all who own Thee,
Cast out our pride and shame

Verse 3
That hinder to enthrone Thee;
The world has waited long,
Has travailed long in pain,

Verse 3
To heal its ancient wrong,
Come, Prince of Peace, and reign.
