554 - O Let Me Walk With Thee

Verse 1
O let me walk with Thee, my God,
As Enoch walked in days of old;
Place Thou my trembling hand in Thine,

Verse 1
And sweet communion with me hold;
E'en though the path I may not see,
Yet, Jesus, let me walk with Thee.

Verse 2
I cannot, dare not, walk alone;
The tempest rages in the sky,
A thousand snares beset my feet,

Verse 2
A thousand foes are lurking nigh.
Still Thou the raging of the sea,
O Master! let me walk with Thee.

Verse 3
If I may rest my hand in Thine,
I'll count the joys of earth but loss,
And firmly, bravely journey on;

Verse 3
I'll bear the banner of the cross
Till Zion's glorious gates I see;
Yet, Savior, let me walk with Thee.
