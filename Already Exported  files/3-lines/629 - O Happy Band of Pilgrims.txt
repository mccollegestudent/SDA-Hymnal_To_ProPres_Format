If onward ye will tread
With Jesus as your fellow,

To Jesus as your Head!

O happy if ye labor
As Jesus did for men;
O happy if ye hunger

The trials that beset you,
The sorrows ye endure,
The manifold temptations

That death alone can cure,

What are they but His jewels
Of right celestial worth?
What are they but the ladder

Set up to heaven on earth?

O happy band of pilgrims,
Look upward to the skies,
Where such a light affliction

Verse 5
Shall win you such a prize!
