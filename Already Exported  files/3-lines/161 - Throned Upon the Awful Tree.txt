161 - Throned Upon the Awful Tree

Verse 1
Throned upon the awful tree,
Lamb of God, Your grief we see.
Darkness veils Your anguished face;

Verse 1
None its lines of woe can trace.
None can tell what pangs unknown
Hold You silent and alone.

Verse 2
Silent through those three dread hours,
Wrestling with the evil powers,
Left alone with human sin,

Verse 2
Gloom around You and within,
Till th'appointed time is nigh,
Till the Lamb of God may die.

Verse 3
Hark, that cry that peals aloud
Upward through the whelming cloud!
You, the Father's only Son,

Verse 3
You, His own anointed one,
You are asking- can it be?
"Why have You forsaken Me?"

Verse 4
Lord, should fear and anguish roll
Darkly o'er our sinful soul,
You, who once were thus bereft

Verse 4
That Your own might ne'er be left,
Teach us by that bitter cry
In the gloom to know You nigh.
