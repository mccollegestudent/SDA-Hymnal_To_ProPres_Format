Verse 1
In the blood from the cross,
I have been washed from sin;
But to be free from dross,

Verse 1
Still I would enter in.

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,

Chorus
Under the precious blood.

Verse 2
Day by day, hour by hour,
Blessings are sent to me;
But for more of His power,

Verse 2
Ever my prayer shall be.

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,

Chorus
Under the precious blood.

Verse 3
Near to Christ I would live,
Following Him each day;
What I ask He will give;

Verse 3
So then with faith I pray.

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,

Chorus
Under the precious blood.

Verse 4
Now I have peace, sweet peace,
While in this world of sin;
But to pray I'll not cease

Verse 4
Till I am pure within.

Chorus
Deeper yet, deeper yet,
Into the crimson flood;
Deeper yet, deeper yet,

Chorus
Under the precious blood.
