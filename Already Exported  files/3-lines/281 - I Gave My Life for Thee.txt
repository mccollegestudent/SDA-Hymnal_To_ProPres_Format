Verse 1
I gave my life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might'st ransom be,

And quickened from the dead;
I gave, I gave My life for thee,
What hast thou given for Me?

I gave, I gave My life for thee,
What hast thou given for Me?

Verse 2
My Fathers house of light,
My glory circled throne,
I left for earthly night,

For wanderings sad and lone;
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for Me? 

Verse 2
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for Me? 

Verse 3
I suffered much for thee,
more than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitterest agony,

Verse 3
To rescue thee from hell;
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for Me?

Verse 3
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for Me?
