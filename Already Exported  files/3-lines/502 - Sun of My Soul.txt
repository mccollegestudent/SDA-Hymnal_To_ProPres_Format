Verse 1
Sun of my soul, O Savior dear!
It is not night if Thou be near;
O may no earth-born cloud arise

Verse 1
To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.

Verse 2
When soft the dews of kindly sleep
My weary eyelids gently steep,
Be my last thought how sweet to rest

Verse 2
Forever on my Savior's breast!

Verse 3
Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live;
Abide with me when night is nigh, 

Verse 3
For without Thee I dare not die.

Verse 4
Be near and bless me when I wake,
Ere through the world my way I take;
Till in the ocean of Thy love

Verse 4
I lose myself in heaven above.
