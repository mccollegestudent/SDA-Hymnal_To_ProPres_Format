095 - Spring Has Now Unwrapped the Flowers

Verse 1
Spring has now unwrapped the flowers,
Day is fast reviving,
Life in all her growing powers

Verse 1
Towards the light is striving:
Gone the iron touch of cold,
Winter time and frost time,

Verse 1
Seedlings, working through the mould,
Now make up for lost time.

Verse 2
Herb and plant that winter long,
Slumbered at their leisurek,
Now be stirring, green and strong,

Verse 2
Find in growth their pleasure:
All the world with beauty fills,
Gold the green enhacing;

Verse 2
Flowers make glee among the hills,
Set the meadows dancing.

Verse 3
Through each wonder of fair days
God Himself expresses;
Beauty follows all His ways,

Verse 3
As the world He blesses:
So, as He renews the earth,
Artist without rival,

Verse 3
In His grace of glad new birth
We must seek revival.
