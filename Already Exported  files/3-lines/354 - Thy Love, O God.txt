In pity look upon Thy children's striving
For life and freedom, peace and brotherhood,
Till at the fullness of Thy truth arriving,

Inspire Thy church, mid earth's discordant voices,
To preach the gospel of her Lord above,
Until the day this warring world rejoices

To hear the mighty harmonies of love.
