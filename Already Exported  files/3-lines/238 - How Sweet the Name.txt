How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,

And calms the troubled breast;
"Tis manna to the hungry soul,

Dear name, the rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place,
My neverfailing treasury, filled

Jesus! my Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest, and King!
My Lord, my life, my way, my end!

Weak is the effort of my heart,
And cold my warmest thought;
But when I see Thee as Thou art,
