295 - Chief of Sinners

Verse 1
Chief of sinners though I be,
Jesus shed His blood for me;
Died that I might live on high,

Verse 1
Died that I might never die;
As the brance is to the vine,
I am His, and He is mine.

Verse 2
O the height of Jesus' love! 
Higher than the heaven above,
Deeper than the deepest sea,

Verse 2
Lasting as eternity;
Love that found me-wondrous thought!
Found me when I sought Him not!

Verse 3
Chief of sinners though I be,
Christ is all in all to me;
All my wants to Him are known,

Verse 3
All my sorrows are His own;
Safe with Him from earthly strife,
He sustains the hidden life.
