583 - You That Know the Lord

Verse 1
You that know the Lord is gracious,
You for whom a cornerstone 
Stands, of God elect and precious,

Verse 1
Laid that you may build there-on,
See that on that sure foundation 
You a living temple raise.

Verse 1
Towers that may tell forth salvation, 
Walls that may reech-o praise.

Verse 2
Living stones by God appointed
Each to his allotted place,
Kings and priests, by God anointed,

Verse 2
Shall you not declare His grace?
You, a royal generation, 
Tell the tidings of your birth,

Verse 2
Tidings of a new creation
To an old and weary earth.

Verse 3
Tell the praise of Him who called you
Out of darkness into light,
Broke the fetters that enthralled you,

Verse 3
Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:
Tell the tale of sins forgiven,
Strength renewed and hope restored,

Verse 3
Till the earth, in tune with heaven, 
Praise and magnify the Lord.
