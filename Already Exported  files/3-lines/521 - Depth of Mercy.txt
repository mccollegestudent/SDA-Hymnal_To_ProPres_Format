Depth of mercy!--can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear?

Long provoked Him to His face,
Would not hearken to His calls,

Grieved Him by a thousand falls.

Now incline me to repent;
Let me now my sins lament;
Now my foul revolt deplore,

There for me the Savior stands,
Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;
God is love! I know, I feel;
