560 - Let All Things Now Living

Verse 1
Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving
To God the Creator triumphantly raise,
Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us,

Verse 1
Who guideth us on to the end of our days.
His banners are o'er us,
His light goes before us,

Verse 1
A pillar of fire shining forth in the night,
'Til shadows have vanished and darkness is banished,
as forward we travel from light into light.

Verse 2
His law He enforces: the stars in their courses,
The sun in His orbit, obediently shine;
The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,

Verse 2
The deeps of the ocean proclaim Him divine,
We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,
With glad adoration a song let us raise,

Verse 2
'Til all things now living unite in thanksgiving
To God in the highest, hosanna and praise.
