410 - Thy Broken Body, Gracious Lord

Verse 1
Thy broken body, gracious Lord,
Is shadowed by this broken bread;
The wine which in this cup is poured,

Verse 1
Points to the blood which Thou hast shed.

Verse 2
And while we meet together thus,
We show that we are one in Thee;
Thy precious blood was shed for us,

Verse 2
Thy death, O Lord, hast set us free!

Verse 3
We have one hope that Thou wilt come,
Thee in the air we wait to see;
When Thou wilt give Thy saints a home,

Verse 3
And we shall ever reign with Thee.
