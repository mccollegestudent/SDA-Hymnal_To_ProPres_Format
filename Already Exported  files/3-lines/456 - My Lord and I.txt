I could not live apart form Him,

Sometimes I'm faint and weary,
He knows that I am weak,
And as He bids me lean on Him,

His help I gladly seek;
He leads me in the paths of light,
Beneath a sunny sky,

My Lord and I.

I tell Him all that pleases me,

I tell Him what annoys;
He tells me what I ought to do,
He tells me how to try,

He knows that I am longing
Some weary soul to win,
And so He bids me go and speak

And why He came to die,

And so we work together,
My Lord and I.
