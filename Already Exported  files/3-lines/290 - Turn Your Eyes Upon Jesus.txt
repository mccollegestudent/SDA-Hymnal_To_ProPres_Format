Verse 1
O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior,

Verse 1
And life more abundant and free!

Chorus
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

Chorus
In the light of His glory and grace.

Verse 2
Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion--

Verse 2
For more than conquerors we are!

Chorus
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

Chorus
In the light of His glory and grace.

Verse 3
His Word shall not fail you--He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well:
Then go to a world that is dying,

Verse 3
His perfect salvation to tell!

Chorus
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

Chorus
In the light of His glory and grace.
