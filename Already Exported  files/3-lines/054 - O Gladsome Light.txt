054 - O Gladsome Light

Verse 1
O gladsome light, O grace
Of God the Father's face,
The eternal splendor wearing;

Verse 1
Celestial, holy, blest,
Our Savior, Jesus Christ,
Joyful in Thine appearing.

Verse 2
Now e'er day fadeth quite,
We see the ev'ning light,
Our wonted hymn ourpouring;

Verse 2
Father of might unknown,
Thee His incarnate Son,
And Holy Spirit adoring.

Verse 3
To Thee of right belongs
All praise of holy songs,
O Son of God, life giver;

Verse 3
Thee therefore, O most high,
The world doth glorify
And shall exalt for ever.
