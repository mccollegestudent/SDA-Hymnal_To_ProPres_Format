227 - Jesus Shall Reign

Verse 1
Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,

Verse 1
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

Verse 2
People and realms of ev'ry tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song,
And infant voices shall proclaim

Verse 2
Their early blessings on His name.

Verse 3
Blessings abound wherever He reigns;
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;
The weary find eternal rest,

Verse 3
And all who suffer want are blessed.

Verse 4
Let every creature rise and bring
Honors peculiar to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,

Verse 4
And earth repeat the loud amen!
