Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,

We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear,
But we believe it was for us

He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heaven,

There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate

Of heaven, and let us in.

And we must love Him too,
And trust in His redeeming blood,

Verse 5
And try His works to do.
