Before our Father's throne
we pour our ardent prayers;
our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,

our comforts and our cares.

We share each other's woes,
our mutual burdens bear;
and often for each other flows

the sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part,
it gives us inward pain;
but we shall still be joined in heart,

Verse 4
and hope to meet again.
