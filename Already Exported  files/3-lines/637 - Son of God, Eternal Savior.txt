You our head, who throned in glory,
For Your own will ever plead:

Fill us with Your love and pity,
Heal our wrongs, and help our need.

Bind us all as one together
In Your church's sacred fold,
Weak and healthy, poor and wealthy,

Sad and joyful, young and old.
Is there want or pain or sorrow?
Make us all the burden share.

Are there spirits crushed and broken?
Teach us, Lord, to soothe their care.

As You, Lord, have lived for others,
So may we for others live.
Freely have Your gifts been granted;

Yours the gold and Yours the silver,
Yours the wealth of land and sea;

We but stewards of Your bounty
Held in solemn trust will be.

Come, O Christ, and reign among us,
King of love and Prince of Peace;
Hush the storm of strife and passion,

By Your patient years of toiling,
By Your silent hours of pain,

Quench our fevered thirst of pleasure,
Stem our selfish greed of gain.

Source of life and truth and grace,
Word made flesh, whose birth among us

By Your praying, by Your willing
That Your people should be one,

Grant, oh, grant our hope's fruition:
Here on earth Your will be done.
