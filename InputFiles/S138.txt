138 - Rise Up, Shepherd, and Follow

1
There's a star in the east on Christmas morn.
Rise Up, shepherd, and follow.
It will lead to the place where the Savior's born,
Rise Up, shepherd, and follow.

Refrain
Leave your sheep and leave your lamb,
Rise Up, shepherd, and follow.
Leave your ewes and leave your rams,
Rise Up, shepherd, and follow. Follow, Follow,
Rise Up, shepherd, and follow.
Follow the star of Bethlehem,
Rise Up, shepherd, and follow.

2
If you take goo heed tothe angel's words,
Rise Up, shepherd, and follow.
You'll forget your flocks, you'll forget your herds
Rise Up, shepherd, and follow.
