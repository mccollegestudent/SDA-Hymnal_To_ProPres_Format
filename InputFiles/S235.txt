235 - Christ Is Made the Sure Foundation

1
Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ, our head and cornerstone,
Chosen of the Lord and precious,
Binding all the Church in one;
Holy Zion's help forever
And our confidence alone.

2
To this temple where we call You,
Come, O Lord of hosts, and stay;
Come, with all Your loving kindness,
Hear Your people as they pray;
And Your fullest benediction
Shed within these walls today.

3
Grant, we pray to all Your faithful
All the gifts they ask to gain;
What they gain from You forever
With the blessed to retain;
And hereafter in Your glory
Evermore with You to reign.

4
Praise and honor to the Father,
Praise and honor to the Son,
Praise and honor to the Spirit,
Ever three and ever one:
One in might and one in glory
While unending ages run!
