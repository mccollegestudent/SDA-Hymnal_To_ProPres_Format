555 - Shepherd of Tender Youth

Verse 1
Shepherd of tender you, 
Guiding in love and truth,
Through devious way; 
Christ our triumphant King, 
We come Thy name to sin, 

Verse 1
Hither our children bring
To shout Thy praise.

Verse 2
Thou are our holy Lord, 
Thee all subduing Word,
Healer of strife; 
Thou didst Thyself abase,
That from sin's deep disgrace 

Verse 2
Thou mightest save our race,
And give us life.

Verse 3
Thou are the great High Priest; 
Thou has prepared the feast
Of heavenly love; 
While in our mortal pain
None call on Thee in vain;

Verse 3
Help Thou does not disdain,
Help from above.

Verse 4
Ever be Thou our Guide,
Our Shepherd and our pride,
Our staff and song; 
Jesus, Thou Christ of God,
By Thy perennial word,

Verse 4
Lead us where Thou hast trod,
Make our faith strong.
