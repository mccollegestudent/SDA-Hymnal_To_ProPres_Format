219 - When Jesus Comes in Glory

Verse 1
When Jesus comes in glory,
As Lord and King of kings,
O what a wondrous story
The blessed Bible brings:
His face will shine like sunlight,

Verse 1
His head be white as snow,
His eyes like flaming firelight,
His feet like brass aglow.

Verse 2
His voice like rushing waters
Will reach with mighty sound
Into the deepest quarters
Of all creation round;
And at this wondrous greeting

Verse 2
The dead in Christ shall rise,
Their Lord and Savior meeting
In glory in the skies.

Verse 3
And we who are believing
And His appearing love,
Shall know we are receiving
His glory from above;
His resurrection power

Verse 3
Will raise us to the place
Where we that wondrous hour
Shall see Him face to face.

Verse 4
O hasten Thine appearing,
Thou bright and Morning Star!
Lord, may we soon be hearing
The trumpet sound afar;
Thy people all are yearning

Verse 4
To be Thy raptured bride,
And at Thine own returning
Be caught up to Thy side.
