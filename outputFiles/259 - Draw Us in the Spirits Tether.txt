259 - Draw Us in the Spirit's Tether

Verse 1
Draw us in the Spirit's tether,
For when humbly in Thy name,
Two or three are met together,
Thou art in the midst of them;
Alleluia! Alleluia!

Verse 1
Touch we now Thy garment's hem.

Verse 2
As the brethren used to gather
In the name of Christ to sup,
Then with thanks to God the Father
Break the bread and bless the cup,
Alleluia! Alleluia!

Verse 2
So knit Thou our friendship up

Verse 3
All our meals and all our living
Make us sacraments of Thee,
That by caring, helping, giving,
We may true disciples be.
Alleluia! Alleluia!

Verse 3
We will serve Thee faithfully.
