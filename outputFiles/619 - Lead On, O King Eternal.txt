619 - Lead On, O King Eternal

Verse 1
Lead on, O King eternal,
the day of march has come;
henceforth in fields of conquest
thy tents shall be our home.
Through days of preparation

Verse 1
thy grace has made us strong;
and now, O King eternal,
we lift our battle song.

Verse 2
Lead on, O King eternal,
till sin's fierce war shall cease,
and holiness shall whisper
the sweet amen of peace.
For not with swords loud clashing,

Verse 2
nor roll of stirring drums;
with deeds of love and mercy
the heavenly kingdom comes.

Verse 3
Lead on, O King eternal,
we follow, not with fears,
for gladness breaks like morning
where'er thy face appears.
Thy cross is lifted o'er us,

Verse 3
we journey in its light;
the crown awaits the conquest;
lead on, O God of might.
