Intro
300 - Rock of Ages

Verse 1
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,

Verse 1
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

Verse 2
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;

Verse 2
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Verse 3
When my pilgrimage I close;
Victor o'er the last of foes,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Verse 3
Let me hide myself in Thee.
