170 - Come, You Faithful

Verse 1
Come, you faithful, raise the strain
Of triumphant gladness;
God has brought His Israel
Into joy from sadness;
Loosed from Pharoah's bitter yoke

Verse 1
Jacob's sons and daughters;
Led them with unmoistened foot
Through the Red Sea waters.

Verse 2
'Tis the spring of souls today;
Christ has burst His prison,
And from three days'sleep in death
As a sun has risen;
All the winter of our sins,

Verse 2
Long and dark, is flying
From His light, to whom is giv'n
Laud and praise undying.

Verse 3
Now the queen of seasons, bright
With the day of splendor,
With the royal feast of feasts,
Comes its joy to render;
Comes to gladden faithful hearts

Verse 3
Which with true affection
Welcome in unwearied strain
Jesus'resurrection.

Verse 4
For today among the twelve
Christ appeared, be stowing
His deep peace, which evermore
Passes human knowing.
Neither could the gates of death,

Verse 4
Nor the tomb's dark portal,
Nor the watchers, nor the seal,
Hold Him as a mortal.

Verse 5
"Alleluia!" now we cry
To our King immortal,
Who, triumphant, burst the bars 
Of the tomb's dark portal;
"Alleluia" with the Son,

Verse 5
God the Father praising;
"Alleluia!" yet again
To the Spirit raising.
