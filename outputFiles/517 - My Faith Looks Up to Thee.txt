517 - My Faith Looks Up to Thee

Verse 1
My faith looks up to thee,
thou Lamb of Calvary,
Savior divine;
Now hear me while I pray,
take all my guilt away,

Verse 1
O let me from this day
be wholly Thine.

Verse 2
May thy rich grace impart
strength to my fainting heart,
my zeal inspire!
As thou hast died for me,
O may my love to thee

Verse 2
pure, warm, and changeless be,
a living fire!

Verse 3
While life's dark maze I tread,
and griefs around me spread,
be thou my guide;
bid darkness turn to day,
wipe sorrow's tears away,

Verse 3
nor let me ever stray
from Thee aside.
