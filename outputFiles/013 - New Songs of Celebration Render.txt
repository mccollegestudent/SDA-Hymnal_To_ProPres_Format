013 - New Songs of Celebration Render

Verse 1
New songs of celebration render
To Him who has great wonders done.
Love sits enthroned in ageless splendor:
Come, and adore the mighty One.
He has made known His great salvation

Verse 1
Which all His friends with joy confess:
He has revealed to every nation
His everlasting righteousness.

Verse 2
Joyfully, heartily resounding,
Let every instrument and voice
Peal out the praise of grace abounding
Calling the whole world to rejoice.
Trumpets and organs, set in motion

Verse 2
Such sounds as make the heavens ring;
All things that live in earth and ocean,
Make music for your mighty King.

Verse 3
Rivers and seas and torrents roaring,
Honor the Lord with wild acclaim;
Mountains and stones look up adoring,
And find a voice to praise His name.
Righteous, commanding, ever glorious,

Verse 3
Praises be His that never cease:
Just is our God, whose truth victorious,
Establishes the world in peace.
