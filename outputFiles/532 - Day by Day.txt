532 - Day by Day

Verse 1
Day by day, and with each passing moment,
Strength I find, to meet my trials here;
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,
I've no cause for worry or for fear.
He whose heart is kind beyond all measure

Verse 1
Gives unto each day what He deems best.
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.

Verse 2
Every day, the Lord Himself is near me
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
He whose name is Counselor and power.
The protection of His child and treasure

Verse 2
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
As your days, your strength shall be in measure,
This the pledge to me He made.

Verse 3
Help me then in every tribulation
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith's sweet consolation
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,

Verse 3
E'er to take, as from a father's hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till I reach the promised land.
