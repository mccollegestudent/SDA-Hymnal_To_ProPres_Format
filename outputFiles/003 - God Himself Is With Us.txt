003 - God Himself Is With Us

Verse 1
God Himself is with us; Let us all adore Him,
And with awe appear before Him.
God is here within us; 
Soul, in silence fear Him,Humbly, 
fervently draw near Him.

Verse 1
Now His own who have known God,
 in worship lowly,Yield their spirits wholly.

Verse 2
Come, abide within me; 
Let my soul, like Mary,
Be thine earthly sanctuary,
Come, in-dwelling Spirit, 
With transfigured splendour;

Verse 2
Love and honour will I render.
Where I go here below, 
Let me bow before Thee.

Verse 3
Gladly we surrender 
Earth’s deceitful treasures,
Pride of Life, and sinful pleasures:
Gladly, Lord, we offer Thine to be forever,
Soul and life and each endeavour.

Verse 3
Thou alone shalt be known 
Lord of all our being,
Life’s true way declaring.
