Verse 1
Take time to be holy,
speak oft with thy Lord;
abide in him always,
and feed on his word.
Make friends of God's children,

Verse 1
help those who are weak,
forgetting in nothing
his blessing to seek.

Verse 2
Take time to be holy,
the world rushes on;
spend much time in secret
with Jesus alone.
By looking to Jesus,

Verse 2
like him thou shalt be;
thy friends in thy conduct
his likeness shall see.

Verse 3
Take time to be holy,
let him be thy guide,
and run not before him,
whatever betide.
In joy or in sorrow,

Verse 3
still follow the Lord,
and, looking to Jesus,
still trust in his word.

Verse 4
Take time to be holy,
be calm in thy soul,
each thought and each motive
beneath his control.
Thus led by his spirit

Verse 4
to fountains of love,
thou soon shalt be fitted
for service above.
