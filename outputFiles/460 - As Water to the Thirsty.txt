Intro
460 - As Water to the Thirsty

Verse 1
As water to the thirsty,
As beauty to the eyes,
As strength that follows weakness,
As truth instead of lies;
As songtime and springtime and summertime to be,

Verse 1
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.

Verse 2
Like calm in place of clamor
Like peace that follows pain,
Like meeting after parting,
Like sunshine after rain;
Like moonlight and starlight and sunlight on the sea,

Verse 2
So is my Lord, my living Lord,
So is my Lord to me.

Verse 3
As sleep that follows fever,
As gold instead of grey,
As freedom after bondage,
As sunrise to the day;
As home to the trav'ler and all he longs to see,

Verse 3
So is my Lord, my Living Lord to me.
