370 - Christ for the World

Verse 1
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,
with loving zeal;
the poor, and them that mourn,
the faint and overborne,

Verse 1
sinsick and sorrow-worn,
whom Christ doth heal.

Verse 2
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,
with fervent prayer;
the wayward and the lost,
by restless passions tossed,

Verse 2
redeemed at countless cost,
from dark despair.

Verse 3
Christ for the world we sing,
the world to Christ we bring,
with joyful song;
the newborn souls, whose days,
reclaimed from error's ways,

Verse 3
inspired with hope and praise,
to Christ belong.
